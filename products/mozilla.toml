notes = ["\"Mozilla receives your email address and a hash of your password when you create a Firefox Account or sign-up to Join Firefox. You can choose to include a display name or profile image. Your email address is sent to our email vendor, SalesForce Marketing Cloud, which has its own privacy policy. Firefox by default sends search queries to your search provider to help you discover common phrases other people have searched for and improve your search experience. Firefox always asks before determining and sharing your location with a requesting website (for example, if a map website needs your location to provide directions). To determine location, Firefox may use your operating system's geolocation features, Wi-fi networks, cell phone towers, or IP address, and may send this data to Google's geolocation service, which has its own [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/privacy/lsf.html).\" \r\n\r\n \"On Android: Firefox by default sends mobile campaign data to Adjust, our analytics vendor, which has its own [privacy policy](https://www.adjust.com/terms/privacy-policy/).

This data allows us to test different features and experiences, as well as provide customized messages and recommendations for improving your experience with Firefox.\" \r\n\r\n \"Thunderbird is a project of MZLA Technologies Corporation, a subsidiary of Mozilla Foundation and as such, shares some of the same infrastructure. This means that, from time to time, your data (e.g., crash reports, and technical and interaction data) may be disclosed to Mozilla Corporation and Mozilla Foundation. If so, it will be maintained in accordance with the commitments we make in this Privacy Notice. To simplify the email set-up process, Thunderbird tries to determine the correct settings for your account by contacting Mozilla's configuration database as well as external servers. These include DNS servers and standard autoconfiguration URIs. During this process, your email domain may be sent to Mozilla's configuration database, and your email address may be disclosed to your network administrators. Thunderbird uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host its servers and as a content delivery network. Your device's IP address is collected as part of AWS's server logs. Thunderbird has partnered with Gandi.net to allow you to create a new email address through Thunderbird. If you choose to use this feature, your email address search terms are sent to Gandi.net to return available addresses. In addition, your country location is also shared with Gandi.net to provide the correct prices. You can learn more about Gandi.net's data practices by reading their [Privacy Policy](https://contract.gandi.net/v5/contracts/14420/Privacy_Policy_US_2.0_en.pdf).\""]

notes = ["\"When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs. When you first use Firefox, it uses your IP address to set your default search provider based on your country. We use this data to send you email alerts if we detect suspicious activity, such as account logins from other locations. Firefox uses your IP address to suggest relevant content based on your country and state. For some Firefox users in the United States, Firefox routes DNS requests to a resolver service that has agreed to Mozilla's strict privacy standards for resolvers. System logs of your DNS requests are deleted from the service within 24 hours and are only used for the purpose of DNS resolution. By default on desktop versions of Firefox, we will ask you to share a report with more detailed information about crashes with Mozilla, but you always have the choice to decline. Crash reports include a \"dump file\" of Firefox's memory contents at the time of the crash, which may contain data that identifies you or is otherwise sensitive to you. Mozilla receives your email address and a hash of your password when you create a Firefox Account or sign-up to Join Firefox. You can choose to include a display name or profile image. For security purposes, we store the IP addresses used to access your Firefox Account in order to approximate your city and country.

If you allow a website to send you notifications, Firefox connects with Mozilla and uses your IP address to relay the message. Mozilla's pre-release versions of Firefox (which are distributed through channels such as Nightly, Beta, Developer Edition and TestFlight) are development platforms frequently updated with experimental features and studies. In addition to the data collection described in this Privacy Notice, these versions by default may send certain types of web activity and crash data to Mozilla and in some cases to our partners. Any data collection or sharing adheres to our [Firefox data collection policy](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/Data_Collection) and we will always be transparent and provide you with controls.\" \r\n\r\n \"Thunderbird receives your email address domain.
