It can also include information you provide in surveys, Verizon-sponsored promotions, and grant or job applications.)\n- How you use our services and your devices (Depending on the services you use, this may include: call records containing phone numbers you call and receive calls from, websites you visit, text records, wireless location, application and feature usage, product and device-specific information and identifiers, router connections, service options you choose, mobile and device numbers, video streaming and video packages and usage, movie rental and purchase data, TV and video viewership, speed and other driving characteristics, and other similar information.)\n- How you use our websites and apps (This includes information about your browsing, searching and buying activities; IP address, mobile phone number, device numbers and identifiers, web addresses of the sites you come from and go to next, screen records, browser and operating system information, platform type, connection speed and other attributes.)\n- How our network and your devices are working (Our network equipment monitors conditions such as traffic flow, speed, capacity, power, quality and environmental conditions such as nearby Wi-Fi access points. We may also take pictures of equipment we install or repair. Some Verizon wireless devices include system applications we provide to: collect information about network and device conditions including location, battery life and applications on the device; automatically install apps when you activate your device and with your consent at later times, for example, when you request an app from an advertisement or over the phone. The software collects information when an app it places is first opened or is uninstalled and may update or send notifications about apps on your device. Some apps installed or updated on your device in this way do not appear as icons on your device screen because of their limited utility. For example, they might facilitate the download of apps you select for your device, update apps you already have on your device, or report to an app owner that an app has been opened on the device. You can see and also delete or disable apps installed on your device, whether or not they have visible icons, using your device’s Application Manager under Settings. Apps on your device are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.\n- Location of your wireless devices (We collect cell tower location information. Based on what you have allowed, we may also collect Wi-Fi, Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) and other location information.)"
