These contacts may include: Email; Text (SMS) messages; Telephone calls; Messenger applications (e.g. WhatsApp, etc.); Automated phone calls or text messages.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in having us contact you, our communications to you include an \"opt out\" link to discontinue any further communications.
