  "We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data.

These individuals are bound by confidentiality agreements and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.\n\nWhenever you connect to our Things Cloud service, we use encryption such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) for all information that is being transmitted. However, no method of transmitting or storing data is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to us.\n\nSome parts of our website, such as our blog or forums, may allow you to post personal information, such as your name or email address.
