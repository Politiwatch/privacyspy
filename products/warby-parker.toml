We do not store any payment card information.\n\nWhen you use Prescription Check, you disclose certain information about yourself by (1) answering a series of questions to determine whether you are eligible to participate in the Prescription Check vision test (the “Eligibility Questionnaire”), (2) performing a series of tasks to help licensed optometrists or ophthalmologists (each an “Eye Doctor”) determine whether to issue you an updated prescription (the “Vision Test”), and (3) communicating with Warby Parker or our Eye Doctors in connection with your use of Prescription Check. The In-Store Prescription Check Vision Test includes an acuity test and measurement of your refractive error using a handheld device, and the results of both will be provided to us.\n\"Health Information\" is information that relates to your past and present health or vision conditions (including medications, ailments, and prescriptions) that is derived from your use of Prescription Check or MyVisionDirectory. Some Health Information may be subject to laws and regulations, including HIPAA. You represent that any Health Information that you disclose to us is your Health Information that you are authorized to disclose to us. “Personal Information” is information about you, including your first name, last name, and demographic information, derived from your use of Prescription Check or MyVisionDirectory. Your Warby Parker account may contain Personal Information and Health Information, and we will access such information when you use Prescription Check. Additionally, in order to facilitate your use of Prescription Check and to help an Eye Doctor determine your need for an eyewear prescription, we may collect the following information when you use Prescription Check: your name, age, email address, username, or other Personal Information or Health Information contained in your Warby Parker account; answers and written information that you submit during the Eligibility Questionnaire; your answers to, performance of, and actions taken during the Vision Test timestamps of all actions that you take within the Prescription Check App; Health Information prepared by an Eye Doctor who provides you Services, such as medical records, prescriptions, treatment decisions, medical advice, examination notes, and any other information prepared by an Eye Doctor about your health or vision; billing information that you provide us, such as credit card information; any other information that you submit to us in connection with your Eligibility Questionnaire, Vision Test, Prescription Check, or the Services, including information exchanged in emails, texts, chats, or calls between you and Warby Parker.\n\nWe do everything possible to make sure you have an exceptional shopping experience. If you contact us in person, by phone (calling or texting), email, instant message (including Facebook Messenger), live chat, through social media or our App, or by some other means, we may keep a record of your contact information and the content of the communication for later reference.

This information may include device and browser information, internet protocol (IP) address, URLs of referring/exit pages, and search terms.\n\nWhen you connect to our in-store Wi-Fi, we receive information about you and your device, including your device’s MAC address, IP address, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and technical details about your device such as its operating system, device type (including make and model), and technical capabilities. We will also receive information about how you use our Wi-Fi network while you are connected, including the store location, the areas of the store you visit, the names and/or Internet addresses of the websites you visit and the applications you use, and how long you interact with such sites or applications. If your mobile device is configured to search for available Wi-Fi networks, we may receive information about your device even if you choose not to connect to our Wi-Fi services.\n\nWhen you download and use our Warby Parker App, we receive information from your mobile device, such as IP address, device information, and unique device identifiers. We may also receive information about your precise location from your device, but only if you enable location tracking on your device. We may collect location data when your device is near our in-store systems, even if you are not currently using the app. You may turn off this location tracking at any time in your app settings or by disabling Bluetooth on your device.\n\nWhen you use the Prescription Check App, we may collect information about your mobile device, such as IP address, device information, and unique device identifiers, and we may derive your approximate location from your IP address. When you permit the Prescription Check App to access your location through your mobile device settings, we may collect the precise location of your device when the Prescription Check App is running in the foreground or background. Your location information is necessary to confirm your location while using the Prescription Check App, so we can be sure that your results are reviewed by an Eye Doctor licensed in your state.\n\nLike most websites, our Services may incorporate technology such as “pixel tags”, “web beacons”, and “cookies” that allow us and our service providers to collect information about your actions on our Services. Our service providers may collect information about your online activities over time and across different online services. Cookies (not to be confused with the sugary morsels) are small files that web servers may place on your computer when you visit a website. You may be able to set your web browser to reject cookies entirely or require that it request permission from you before accepting each new cookie. You can also delete cookies from your web browser once you leave a website.\n\nWe may also collect information when you are visiting our stores. Like most retailers, we have in-store video surveillance for security, fraud, and loss prevention purposes. In addition, we analyze videos to help us understand customer behavior and retail traffic within our physical spaces. Our service providers may also collect information about your mobile device from other tracking technologies while you are near or in our stores to help us better understand our customers and how they use our Services."
