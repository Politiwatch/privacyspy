  "We use analytics software to help us deliver a higher quality of service.

Viewing longer term trends in the number of visitors from different countries also allows us to identify quickly which countries have started to block the Service and take measures to counteract those blocks. Finally, analytics also helps with our outreach and growth initiatives, which are efforts to help our Company reach and protect the largest number of people possible.\n\nHow do we collect non-personal website data: We may use various cookies to collect and store information when you visit our website. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level."
