  "We store most of your personal information electronically.

Please see further information on the security measures we engage on our websites and platform and when you use any of our services.\n\nWe work hard to protect you and FastMail from unauthorised access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold. Measures we take include:\n\n- placing confidentiality requirements and restricted access protocols on our staff members and service providers who need access to your information in order to process it to provide our services to you;\n- destroying your personal information if it is no longer needed to provide you with our service;\n- destroying logging or other transactional information that may incidentally contain personal information in accordance with our schedules to clear such information;\n- following strict security procedures in the access, storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it; and\n- using secure communication transmission software (known as \"secure sockets layer\" or \"SSL\") that encrypts all information you input on our website before it is sent to us. SSL is an industry standard encryption protocol and this ensure that the information is reasonably protected against unauthorised interception.\nAs the security of information depends in part on the security of the computer and/or device you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect your user IDs and passwords, please take appropriate measures to protect this information."

We also collect some of this information if you are using our services on a trial basis. Our help page on each service explains how your information is deleted if you decide not to proceed.\n\nWe may also collect personal information such as IP address, device information and log information by using cookies. Please see Cookies for more information on this and our Cookies Policy.\n\nWe process mail sent and received from your account to block spam and fraud. We receive information from third party services to assist us in identifying spam. If you report a message to us, either through the service or via customer support, as spam or not spam, we may share that message with the third party service that flagged it to improve the accuracy of future filtering. See further below on your rights when we disclose your information to our third party service providers.\n\nWe also store information from your address book, calendar, notes and files on our servers until you delete them (for more information on data retention see our security help page). We will also share this information with your devices and external accounts where you have authorised us to do so.\n\nWe also collect the email content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. We use this information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you add addresses to messages by suggesting recipients from your contacts.\n\nEach time you connect to our service, we log your IP address, your client identifier (browser or mail client information) and your username. If you send mail, we also log the email address you're using to send mail and the email address you're sending to. If you take action on mail in your mailbox, we also log the activities taken. This is necessary for providing proof of delivery and fraud analysis. For example, we need this information for detecting deliverability issues if there are failures sending email that we either detect through monitoring or when you ask if email you are sending/receiving is working properly. We also need your IP address and username to help you validate if someone else has gained access to your account to send spam or for other fraudulent purposes.\n[...]\nIn a multi-user account, if you are permitted to access and use a user account on any of our services by the registered user directly, we may collect the following information about you: IP address and name.\n\nThe registered account holder is responsible for your access and use if they provide you with access to and use of an account and the Personal Information residing in that account."
