  "We have implemented information security measures that contain administrative, technical and physical controls that are designed to\nreasonably safeguard Personal and Non-Personal Information. Even though We have taken and will continue to take significant steps\nto protect this information, no company, including us, can fully eliminate all security risks associated with Personal Information. We use\nvarious security measures, including Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, to protect information collected, transferred\nand retained. If You elect to set up an account on the Sites, You will be asked to provide an email address and password. You must\nprovide a valid email address and password in order to create and maintain an account, as well as to access account information. We\nrecommend You select a password with at least 8 characters and consider adding numbers or special characters to further strengthen\nYour password. In order to help protect Your personal information, You should be careful about providing Your password to others and\nchange it periodically. If You wish to update a password, or if You become aware of any loss, theft or unauthorized use of a password,\nplease contact us at us-privacy@gandi.net.\nMoreover, we strongly recommend You to active Our two-factor auth feature to enhance Your security. Please be aware that We may\nstore Personal Information or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Our affiliates, agents or third\nparty service providers. We take all commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and confidentiality of all Personal Information\nprovided via the Sites from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, inadvertent disclosure, alteration and/or destruction.

Identity theft and the practice currently known as \"phishing\" are of great concern to us. Safeguarding information to\nhelp protect You from identity theft is one of Our priorities.
