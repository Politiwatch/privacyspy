  "As part of the process of selecting what advertising to provide you we do not consider any of your previous search history or any other Personal Data that identifies you.

For example, if you search for “flower shops” we may display an advertisement/search result for one or more flower shops. We will sometimes provide your Search Query and/or your general location to advertising partners in order to provide you with advertisements/search results but the information they receive is never identifiable to you as we do not provide your IP Address to any advertising partners."
