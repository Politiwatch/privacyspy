  "Usage Tracking for Business Development and Management\n\nOur primary business is conducted entirely online. As such, our success will depend on our ability to gauge popularity of one feature or product offering over another, or on our ability to understand how people use our products. Tracking and aggregating usage information will allow us to develop this understanding.\n\nOur Communications Features\n\nOur site offers registered users the ability to forward along objects of interest to others, and in some cases to communicate with an auction house concerning an object offered in an upcoming auction. In order to facilitate this communication, a registered user's email of record must be accessed.\n\nAs a service to auction houses, we keep track of communications between registered users and auction houses. Not all auction houses permit direct communication with our users. We may store destination emails sent by users to auction houses with questions or request for more information about an object. If an auction house requests more information about a user, we may share that information if we determine that is in our interest to do so. We may disable your capability to communicate with a specific auction house. We may also revoke your auction house communication privileges at any time without notifying you if we determine that it is in our interest to do so.\n\nCommunications with Our Customers, Customer Support, and Promotional E-mail\n\nFrom time to time, it may be necessary to notify subscribers of impending subscription expirations, account or credit card issues, transactions completed, and in the case of registered users terms agreement or policy changes. While such communication will typically be conducted through email, as appropriate, mail or phone may also be used. We may also use your personal information to send you e-mail newsletters and other promotional emails about services and products that we believe may be of interest to you.\n\nSubscription Billing\n\nWe charge fees for using our subscription level services. At present, these are Invaluable Basic, Invaluable Premium, Invaluable Professional, Invaluable Institutional, Invaluable Fine Art, Invaluable Collector, Invaluable Enthusiast, Invaluable Dealer, Invaluable Appraiser, Invaluable iFind+, Invaluable Offline Collector Search and Invaluable Offline Professional Search subscriptions. To enable the purchase of these products, Invaluable collects and stores billing and credit card information. This information will be shared only with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of such tasks include processing credit card payments for new subscriptions, subscription renewals and subscription upgrades. Please see Protection of Your Information for other relevant information.\n\nYou may view your entire transaction history, review each invoice processed, and review or update your Credit Card information through the secure My Invaluable page.\n\nAccess Control\n\nIn order to access paid subscription products, you will be required to enter a user name and password through our secure sign-in on each visit. At that time, the current status of your subscription will be checked, and appropriate access given according to the information on file.\n\nCompliance with Legal Process\n\nWe may disclose personal information if we are required to do so by law, or in good faith believe that such action is necessary to: 1) comply with the law or with legal process; 2) protect and defend our rights and property; 3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of Invaluable.com data; or 4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).\n\nCompelled disclosure\n\nNote: Invaluable may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements\n\nSharing Your Personally Identifiable Information\n\nIn some instances, we use third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you, like a shipping company that delivers a package or an e-mail delivery service that sends out our e-mails or e-newsletters. In those instances we need to share your information with them. We require that those companies use the information only to deliver our product or service.\n\nInvaluable will share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity. In the event that such a combination occurs, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice in as provided in Section 2 above.\n\nIf it is clear from the information that you provide us that you are a member of the antiques, art, auction or related trades we may, in our sole discretion list you in directories, or other areas of our site, and may use the name of your firm and your relationship to us in marketing or advertising on our site, or in our promotional materials, paid advertising, or other media in order to promote our services.
