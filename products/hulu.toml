  "Advertisers. We display advertisements from other companies on the Hulu Services, often enabling users to interact with the advertisements or click through to websites or other properties owned or operated by other companies. These advertisers and their service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information, from or about you through the Hulu Services in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements. This information may relate to your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online and may include the information described in Section 2 (“Information We Collect”).

  "We may share information collected from or about you with others, including business partners, social networking services, service providers, advertisers, and other companies that are not affiliated with Hulu, for the purposes described below.\n\nPartners. We work with a number of business partners who help us offer the Hulu Services, including, for example, our content programmers, distributors and device partners, and corporate owners. We may share information collected from or about you with such business partners, including email address, Viewing Information, information about the ads you view on Hulu and account or device information (e.g., age, gender, device type, IP address, ZIP code, advertising identifiers). This information may be shared for different purposes depending on the partner, including for reporting and analytics, activating, administering, and improving and personalizing your experience with Hulu or such partner, including by providing you with more tailored content, features, and ads on Hulu as well as on other platforms and services. We may also engage with companies from time to time to provide you joint promotional offers and opportunities and may share with these companies data you provide or that is collected in connection with those offers (e.g., name and mailing address to fulfill a giveaway).\n\nService Providers. We may share information collected from or about you with companies that provide services to us, our business partners, and advertisers, including companies that assist with payment processing, analytics, data processing and management (e.g., to facilitate our targeted advertising and marketing efforts), account management, hosting, customer and technical support, marketing, advertising , measurement, and other services. The categories of information that we share with service providers will vary depending on the types of services they provide. For example, we share payment information with our third-party payment processor to assist us in our billing efforts, email addresses with our marketing service providers to assist with our email campaigns, and IP address, hashed emails, and advertising identifiers with service providers to assist in our advertising and marketing efforts.\n\nAudience Measurement Providers. Our business partners, such as content programmers, as well as our advertisers, seek to measure the performance of their creative material across many platforms, including the Hulu Services. Accordingly, Hulu may permit the use of third-party measurement software that enables third parties (such as Nielsen) to use information collected from or about you (e.g., Viewing Information, ad exposure data, IP address, advertising identifiers) to include your viewing on the Hulu Services in calculating measurement statistics such as TV Ratings. To learn more about your choices with respect to Nielsen measurement software, please see the information we have provided in Section 6 (“Your Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options”).\n\nAdvertisers. We display advertisements from other companies on the Hulu Services, often enabling users to interact with the advertisements or click through to websites or other properties owned or operated by other companies. These advertisers and their service providers may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information, from or about you through the Hulu Services in order to tailor advertisements, measure advertising effectiveness, and enable other enhancements. This information may relate to your use of the Hulu Services, websites you visited, advertisements you viewed, and your other activities online and may include the information described in Section 2 (“Information We Collect”). We may also compile and provide reports, including in encrypted, aggregated, or de-identified forms, to advertisers about the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\nThird Parties When Required By Law or When Necessary to Protect Your or Our Rights. In some instances, we may disclose information from or about you without providing you a choice. For example, we may disclose your information in the following ways: to protect the legal rights of Hulu and our affiliates or partners; to protect the safety and security of users of the Hulu Services or third parties; to enforce our Terms of Use; to protect against fraud; and to comply with or respond to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government entity, whether or not legally required.\n\nThird Parties in Connection with Certain Transactions. If we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information from or about you to one or more third parties as part of the transaction, including the due diligence process.\n\nParties with Your Consent or When You Otherwise Choose to Share. We may also share information from or about you with any party when we have your consent or when you otherwise choose to share such information. For example, certain functions within the Hulu Services may give you the option to share information about your activities on the Hulu Services, for example, by email, text message, social networking services, or other sharing function. In addition, you may have the option to choose to share information with our advertisers or other partners through an interactive ad unit. Information you share through third party platforms and with social networks, advertisers, and other third parties is subject to their terms of use and privacy policies which we recommend you review."

In addition, Hulu may collect similar information you provide to us when you respond to surveys or interactive ad units, contact Hulu through customer service or communicate with us by other means, or participate in promotions or events. We may also collect information you provide as part of selecting your preferences, including within your account settings, and commercial information, such as the Hulu plan(s) you purchase. Hulu allows multiple profiles to be set up under one account, so we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.\n\nUsage, Technical and Log Data. We collect information when you use the Hulu Services or interact with Hulu, including when you view Hulu advertising outside of the Hulu Services. We may collect information from and about the browser or device you’re using and information about your internet or other electronic network activity, including through analytics tools and the technologies described below (“Data Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies”). This information may include your IP address, device type, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), geolocation data (which may include precise location data), referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., “ad-ID” or “IDFA”) and identifiers associated with browser cookies (see our description of “Cookies and Local Storage” below), and carrier information.

Because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called “browser cookies,” even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer.\n\nYou can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. For information about disabling cookies or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here.
