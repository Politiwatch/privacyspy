  "If you wish to prevent all websites using the FullStory Services to be able to record activity, you can opt-out of the FullStory Services. Opting out will create a cookie that tells FullStory to turn off recording on any site which uses the FullStory Services. The presence of this cookie is required to continue opting out. That means if you clear your browser cookies, you will have to opt-out again. Unfortunately, this is the most permanent and least intrusive solution FullStory can offer because of how browser technology works. You may wish to employ a third party browser extension to block scripts like FullStory instead of using our Opt Out cookie, but know that using any third party extension may pose additional risk.\n\nIf you are considering opting-out, it's probably a good time to make sure you really understand that the purpose of the FullStory Services is to help well-intentioned companies make their website better for you. It is emphatically not one of those we-track-you-around-the-web kind of deals. We think that's creepy, too.\n\nMost people who make websites are just like you: nice people who want to do a good job and make something awesome. And you wouldn't believe how much time and energy product teams spend trying to make their websites great for you. Without the FullStory Services, though, they simply do not have enough information to understand when they get it wrong. If they can see how you actually experience their website, like an ongoing usability study, they'll actually know what to improve! They don't need to record anything sensitive in order to do that, and we have a strict Acceptable Use Policy where you can see for yourself the high standards we expect of FullStory customers with respect to your privacy."
