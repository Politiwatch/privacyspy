These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions. E.g.: \n\n* We use Help Scout to manage customer support requests. We share your name, your email, and your messages with them. \n* We use Honeybadger to notify us when a user encounters an error so we can fix it promptly. We share your device information, IP, and email with them. \n* We use Chargebee to manage billing. They store your name, email, and credit card information. \n\nWe use 30-40 different providers to support our operations. These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed and consistent with this Policy. Padlet has also entered into Data Processing Agreements with parties who process data on our behalf or in connection with the use of the Padlet Service"
