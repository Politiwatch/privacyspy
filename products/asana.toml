Workspace Content is collected, used, and shared by Asana in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, or as required by applicable law. The Customer, and not Asana, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Workspace Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Customer may provide or remove access to the Service, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, or share projects. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings that they have instituted with respect the Workspace Content that you provide when using the Service.\nAccount Information. To set up your Asana account, you or the Customer will provide us with basic information about you which may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, and password. You will then have the ability to provide optional profile information, such as a photograph or basic demographic data.

For example, we may log the number of Workspaces you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; the types of files you share; and what, if any, third party services and integrations you use.\nOther Information. You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); information you provide in connection with Asana sweepstakes, contests, or research studies in which you choose to participate; beta testing; and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).\nInformation Collected from Third-Party Integrations.
