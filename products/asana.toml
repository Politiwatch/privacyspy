Workspace Content is collected, used, and shared by Asana in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, or as required by applicable law. The Customer, and not Asana, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Workspace Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Customer may provide or remove access to the Service, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, or share projects.
