  "Account Data\nWe ask you to provide a password and/or email address when you create an account with us, so that you can log into your account again in the future. We store this information for as long as your account is active. We only use your email address to send you a link to log in with whenever you request it.\n\nAs a paying user, we also store small pieces of your payment information so you can see how you're paying for Write.as. This includes the last 4 digits of your credit card number and its expiration date. We never see, nor store, your name, credit card number, or related information (it's only handled by Stripe, our payment processor).\n\nWe protect your personally identifying information with encryption. We salt and hash your passwords (that is, encrypt them without a way to decrypt them) and encrypt any identifying information in our database, like your email address.\n\nLog Files\nWe store log files, or data about what happens on our servers. This helps us prevent abuse and ensure no one is accessing our servers that shouldn't be.\n\nOur web servers temporarily store information about what IP address connected when. This data is accessed exclusively by our system administrators and developers as needed, and is permanently deleted after seven (7) days.\n\nIf you email or otherwise contact us, our customer support team may retain information you'd find in an email, like first and last name, email address, and any online handles. This data is accessed exclusively by customer support and developers as needed, and helps us provide support, fix things, and generally talk directly to you. In the rare case we need to know your Write.as username, we delete its association with your identifying information as soon as we're done talking.\n\nVisitor Statistics\nWe use an open-source application, called Matomo (formerly Piwik), to analyze visitor statistics. Using Matomo ensures that this data never leaves our servers, and big analytics companies like Google never see your data. It enables us to improve our product while still protecting your identity and data.\n\nOur business team and developers use Matomo to see where visitors come from, how they navigate around the site, and where they potentially get stuck. We often make small improvements to the site simply from seeing this high-level, anonymous data.\n\nMatomo uses cookies, or small text files saved on your computer, but it also respects your browser's Do Not Track (DNT) setting.
