Quad9 DNS Services also builds, stores, and may share certain DNS data streams which store high level information about domain resolved, query types, result codes, and timestamp. These streams do not contain IP address information of requestor and cannot be correlated to IP address or other PII."

  "As an open DNS resolver, there is no signup or requirement to disclose PII to us other than that which is provided by accessing the service. The only method by which Quad9 can identify end user requests is by the IP address of the client. IP addresses may represent individual persons or devices, or they may represent (via NAT or forwarding resolvers) large groups of end users.  Quad9 does not and cannot distinguish between single and multiple users behind a single IP address. [...]  Our normal course of data management does not have any IP address information or other PII logged to disk or transmitted out of the location in which the query was received.\n[...]\n\nWhen you use Quad9 DNS Services, here is the full list of items that are included in our logs:\n- Request domain name, e.g. example.net\n- Record type of requested domain, e.g. A, AAAA, NS, MX, TXT, etc.\n- Transport protocol on which the request arrived, i.e. TCP, UDP, and encryption status of the protocol\n- Origin IP general geolocation information: i.e. geocode, region ID, city ID, and metro code\n- Protocol version IP address – IPv4, or IPv6\n- Response code sent, e.g. SUCCESS, SERVFAIL, NXDOMAIN, etc.\n- Absolute arrival time\n- Name of the Quad9-operated machine that processed this request\n- Quad9 target IP to which this request was addressed (no relation to the user’s IP address)\n\nWe may keep the following data as summary information, including all the above EXCEPT for data about the DNS record requested:\n- Currently-advertised BGP-summarized IP prefix/netmask of apparent client origin\n- Autonomous system number (BGP ASN) of apparent client origin"
