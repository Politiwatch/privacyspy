  "You Provide It to Us\nWe collect information that you enter on our digital properties or give us in other ways (e.g. when you order on Target.com, purchase a product in a Target store or create a gift registry).\n\nAutomated Information Collection\nWe may connect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Target guest. If we are able to identify you as a Target guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity in a Target store or on one of our mobile applications. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us – online, in store, mobile, etc.\n\nIn order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how you are shopping on our website, in our stores, and on our mobile applications, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.\n\nThird-party automated collection\n\nWe and our service providers use anonymous identifiers such as cookies and other technologies to collect and store certain types of information (e.g. click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) whenever you interact with us or third-parties that use our services.\n\nWe also allow third-party companies (e.g., Google) to place tags on our digital properties once approved through our tagging process.

These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.\n\nMobile Location Information\nIf you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile applications, services or our service providers. For example, precise geo-location can be used to help you find nearby Target stores. Or, in-store location through the use of your phone’s blue tooth signal, LED light chip technologies or other technologies will permit Target to find nearby products for you, get you real-time deals, auto-sort your shopping list and more.\n\nTo manage how you share your device’s location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy.\n\nCameras\nWe use cameras in and around our stores for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels. Cameras may also be used for fraud detection, theft prevention and security. When enabled, we may also use your device’s camera (e.g. Apple’s TrueDepth camera) so you can use services such as product visualization (e.g., scan room to see item in your space) or virtual fitting (e.g., scan facial data to try on accessories/beauty products). Information collected from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time - we do not store this information on our servers or share it with third parties.\n\nInformation from other sources\nWe collect information about you from other sources to enhance our existing guest information and improve the accuracy of our records. This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing.\n\n"
