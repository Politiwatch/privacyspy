  "Administrative Safeguards\n\nAccess to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked.\n\nTechnical Safeguards\n\nWe store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize up-to-date firewall  protection for an additional layer of security. We use high-quality antivirus and anti-malware  software, and regularly update our virus  definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to implement privacy and security practices that we deem adequate.\n\nPhysical Safeguards\n\nAccess to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Otherwise, access is limited to our physical premises. Physical removal of Personal Data from our location is forbidden. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards."
