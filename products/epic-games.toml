Information We Collect from Other Sources\nIn some cases, we may also receive information about you from service providers and third parties in connection with your use of the Epic Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.\n\nFor example, some other developers allow you to use your Epic account to log in to their service. And if you choose to link your Epic account with your account on a third-party social media (like Facebook), gaming (like Steam), or other similar website or service, or if you interact with an ad for one of the Epic Services on an external website or service, the company that operates that website or service may share some information with Epic in accordance with their own privacy practices. Your privacy settings on the other company's website or service typically control the specific types of information they can share with Epic, so please be sure to review and update them regularly. Common examples for linked accounts might include your third-party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address. For participants in our Support-a-Creator program, we may also collect the number of social media account followers you have for program eligibility purposes.\n\nYou can also buy, download, or access some Epic Services on or through services operated by third parties. If you do, they may provide us with information to facilitate your access to and use of the Epic Services. This typically includes information like your display name, user ID, and device and region information. For example, you can choose to download and play games like Fortnite on gaming consoles (like PlayStation®, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch) through your gaming console account. When you do, the company operating that platform or service may share some information with us, which helps us do things like facilitate your gameplay and track your progression and entitlements.",

  "2. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?\nThe types of information we collect depend on how you interact with us. Generally speaking, we collect information in three main ways: A) when you provide it to us, B) automatically when you use the Epic Services, and C) from service providers and third parties.\n\nA. Information You Provide\nYou can provide us with different kinds of information depending on how you interact with the Epic Services. Sometimes we'll ask you to provide specific pieces of information, such as when we require it to provide parts of the Epic Services to you (for example, by prompting you to complete an online registration process). If we ask you to provide us with information in these cases and you choose not to, you may not be able to access the relevant Epic Services and/or some features may not operate as intended.\n\nFor instance, in order to make purchases on the Epic Games Store and to play some of our games, you'll need an Epic account. To create one, you'll need to provide us with basic registration information like your name, a public-facing display name, password, the country you live in, and email address. If you want to make a purchase, we may ask you to provide payment-related information (like your credit card number and expiration date) to complete the transaction.\n\nWe also collect the information you voluntarily provide to sign up for email alerts, use social features like forums or chat, register for early access to our games, use our developer tools (including to create and publish games and other content), complete surveys, or contact us through Player Support requests or customer service. If you enter a contest or competitive event, or participate in our Support-A-Creator program, we'll collect your application information and other information we may need to help confirm your eligibility and process payouts. We collect whatever information you choose to provide to us in those or other similar cases.\n\nB. Information We Collect Automatically\nWe collect some information automatically when you visit, access, or use the Epic Services. This includes information about your gameplay or application usage, purchases, entitlements, and other activity in the Epic Services, typically associated with your account (if you are logged into your Epic account or use a third-party account to access the Epic Services) or with an identifier we have assigned to your device or profile. While the specific types of information that we automatically collect may vary, they generally include:\n\nUsage information and statistics about how you interact with the Epic Services, including the application you used or the game you played, how long you used or played it and when, gameplay attempts, progression and results, saved preferences, crash reports, the URLs of our websites that you have visited, URLs of referring and exiting pages, page views, time spent on a page, number of clicks, and platform type;\nTechnical information about your computer, device, hardware, or software you use to access our services, such as IP address, device identifiers, your internet service provider, plugins, or other transactional or identifier information for your device (such as device make and model, information about device operating systems and browsers, or other device or system-related specifications); and\nThe general location of your device, which we typically derive from your device's IP address.\nThe Epic Services use technologies such as cookies, log files, and web beacons to automatically collect the types of information listed above. Some of these technologies may create small files or record-keeping tools that may be stored on your device. They help us, our service providers, and third parties recognize your device and provide information about how you use and interact with the Epic Services. For example, they support our ability to  authenticate users, remember preferences, manage advertising, personalize experiences, and conduct data analytics.\n\nPlease note that if certain features on the Epic Services are provided by third parties, those third parties may also use automated means of data collection and may record information about your use of the Epic Services or others' websites over time. These features are subject to those third parties' privacy notices and policies.\n\nC. Information We Collect from Other Sources\nIn some cases, we may also receive information about you from service providers and third parties in connection with your use of the Epic Services or your interactions with us on other platforms.\n\nFor example, some other developers allow you to use your Epic account to log in to their service. And if you choose to link your Epic account with your account on a third-party social media (like Facebook), gaming (like Steam), or other similar website or service, or if you interact with an ad for one of the Epic Services on an external website or service, the company that operates that website or service may share some information with Epic in accordance with their own privacy practices. Your privacy settings on the other company's website or service typically control the specific types of information they can share with Epic, so please be sure to review and update them regularly. Common examples for linked accounts might include your third-party account display name and user ID, as well as associated device information, name, and email address. For participants in our Support-a-Creator program, we may also collect the number of social media account followers you have for program eligibility purposes.\n\nYou can also buy, download, or access some Epic Services on or through services operated by third parties. If you do, they may provide us with information to facilitate your access to and use of the Epic Services. This typically includes information like your display name, user ID, and device and region information. For example, you can choose to download and play games like Fortnite on gaming consoles (like PlayStation®, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch) through your gaming console account. When you do, the company operating that platform or service may share some information with us, which helps us do things like facilitate your gameplay and track your progression and entitlements.\n\nD. Fraud Prevention & Anti-Cheat\nProviding users with a fair, balanced, and competitive experience on the Epic Services is extremely important to us. We strictly enforce prohibitions against cheating, hacking, account stealing, and any other unauthorized or fraudulent activity on the Epic Services. We use a variety of anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies to help us identify and prevent malicious activity. These services may collect and analyze data about your computer and the software on your computer to detect cheating and may be provided by Epic or by service providers such as BattlEye.",
