  "Categories of Personal Information That You Provide or Authorize Us to Collect\n\nAs you use the Services, we may collect or you may provide information that identifies, relates to, or directly or indirectly describes you or your household and devices (“Personal Information”). Personal Information includes data such as your name and email address, but is not limited to this information. For example, when you contact our customer support services, this may include a record of communication correspondence and associated contact information. We collect the following categories of Personal Information when you use the Services:\n\nSocial Networking Details. Where applicable, you may sign up to use the Services directly via the Site or Application or via certain third-party social networking sites (each, a “Social Networking Site”). If you decide to create an account to use the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the personal information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your “real” name, email address and other information you make available via the Social Networking Site) from the account you have with such Social Networking Site and use that information to connect to a Maple Media application, website, or property; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site.\n\nPurchase Details. If you choose to purchase any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent available, we or our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you, including financial information related to your method of payment, to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods.\n\nOther Information You Provide When You Use the Services. We collect information that you provide in connection with your registration and/or use of the Services (e.g., without limitation, personal identifiers including your birthday, gender, zip code, individual preferences and certain online identifiers and other internet or electronic network activity information about your computer or mobile device, such as operating system, software version and unique advertising identifier).\n\nDevice Information Collected with Your Consent. With your permission and depending on the requirements of the specific Services you are using, we may access additional information from your device, such as your general location, contact lists, photo library, and calendar. For example, to use a calendar Application, calendar permissions would be needed. For a photo editing Application, photo access would be needed. If you choose to give us access, you may also link your use of the Services with your cloud storage accounts.\n\nCertain information we collect may be Personal Information depending on how it is combined with other identifiers (for example, your IP address when combined with other data that enables us to identify you or your household). The same pieces of information may not be Personal Information when taken alone or combined only with non-identifying information.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\n\nOur products may require additional information or permissions from your device in order to function effectively.\n\nLog Data. When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Site, (any of these, a “Maple Media User”), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or application (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as:\n\nyour computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address\nthe browser type or the website or application you were visiting before you came to the Service\npages of the websites or applications involved in the Service that you visit and the time spent on those pages\ninformation you search for\nother details about your interaction with our Services, such as access times and dates, your device’s operating system, software version, unique advertising identifier, and other statistics\nWe use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Service’s technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors’ needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests, as described in more detail below. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data, and such aggregate data is not treated as Personal Information.\n\nCookies and Advertising Identifiers. Like many websites and applications, our Service uses “cookies” and mobile advertising identifiers to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device for record-keeping purposes. An advertising identifier is an anonymous, resettable ID associated with your mobile device that can be managed in your device settings."
