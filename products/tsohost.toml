These uses include:\n- We collect various information relating to your purchase, use and/or interactions with our Services. We utilise this information to: Improve and optimise the operation and performance of our Services (again, including our websites and mobile applications); Diagnose problems with and identify any security risks, errors, or needed enhancements to the Services; Detect and prevent fraud and abuse of our Services and systems; Collecting aggregate statistics about use of the Services; Understand and analyse how you use our Services and what products and services are most relevant to you. Often, much of the data collected is aggregated or statistical data about how individuals use our Services, and is not linked to any personal data, but to the extent it is itself personal data, or is linked or linkable to personal data, we treat it accordingly. \n\n- We may share your personal data with affiliated companies within our corporate family, with third parties with which we have partnered to allow you to integrate their services into our own Services, and with trusted third party service providers as necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, such as: Processing credit card payments; Serving advertisements; Conducting contests or surveys; Performing analysis of our Services and customers demographics; Communicating with you, such as by way email or survey delivery; Customer relationship management.\nWe only share your personal data as necessary for any third party to provide the services as requested or as needed on our behalf.

  "We collect information so that we can provide the best possible experience when you utilise our Services.  Much of what you likely consider personal data is collected directly from you when you: create an account or purchase any of our Services (eg: billing information, including name, address, credit card number); request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (eg: phone number); complete contact forms or request newsletters or other information from us (eg: email); or participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.\nHowever, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance.  These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we wanted to highlight and explain below a bit more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time) and how they work:\n\nAccount related information is collected in association with your use of our Services, such as account number, purchases, when products renew or expire, information requests, support requests and notes or details explaining what you asked for and how we responded.\n\nCookies and similar technologies on our websites allow us to track your browsing behaviour, links clicked, items purchased, your device type, and to collect various data, including analytics, about how you use and interact with our Services. This allows us to provide you with more relevant product offerings, a better experience on our sites and mobile applications, and to collect, analyse and improve the performance of our Services. We may also collect your location (IP address) so that we can personalise our Services. For additional information, and to learn how to manage the technologies we utilise, please visit our Cookie Policy.\n\nData about Usage of Services is automatically collected when you use and interact with our Services, including metadata, log files, cookie/device IDs and location information. This information includes specific data about your interactions with the features, content and links (including those of third-parties, such as social media plugins) contained within the Services, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data, information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and error data, and some of this data collected might be capable of and be used to approximate your location. \n\nSupplemented Data may be received about you from other sources, including publicly available databases or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyse the accuracy of our records, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of interest to you.
