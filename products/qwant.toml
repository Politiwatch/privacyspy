  "We should always ask our search engine what are the personal data that it does not collect üôÇ\n\nTo the maximum of its possibilities and the state of art, Qwant anonymizes the data it needs to collect to deliver its services.\n\nWhen you use Qwant as a search engine, we don‚Äôt put any cookie on your browser that may allow us or others to recognize you or to follow you everywhere on the Internet. We don‚Äôt use any tracking device (pixel, fingerprinting‚Ä¶). We don‚Äôt collect and we don‚Äôt store any history or your searches. When you enter a search query, it is immediately anonymized following the processes detailed below. Long story short, what you are doing with Qwant is part of your privacy and we don‚Äôt want to know.\n\nQwant has a Privacy office dedicated to the protection of your privacy. It also has a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Both work closely with each other to ensure that the relevant regulation regarding personal data is applied as strongly as it should.\n\nThe DPO keeps an updated register of all processing of personal data made by Qwant for its services. For instance, when you create an account on the site, you can choose to fill in your profile and this is a processing of personal data for which the register will say how data may be kept (and how long), and who can access it.\n\nWe commit to do anything we can to ensure the security and confidentiality of our users personal data, including by preventing data damage, loss, or access by unauthorized third parties. Qwant‚Äôs URL has the HTTPS header that shows users they communicate with Qwant through a secure channel using the TLS protocol. Technically, TLS ensures users that their data can‚Äôt be intercepted by fraud. Moreover, the green lock that you see on most browsers when using Qwant certifies that you are browsing a secure website."

  "When Qwant requires Microsoft to transmit ads that match the entered keywords, Qwant anonymizes the required data and therefore only transmits to Microsoft the entered keywords with the User Agent of your browser (that is the type of browser that you use and its version), as well as a salted hash generated from a fraction of your IP address (last octet truncated) and the User Agent. An approximative geographic area of the origin of the search query, to the scale of a region or a city, is sent in order to deliver ads that are more locally relevant (for instance if you search for a plumber)."
