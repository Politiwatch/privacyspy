  "Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your account, if you are an account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third-Party sources) and our privacy practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with Figma and the requirements of applicable law. Some of the ways that Figma may collect Personal Information include:\n\nYou may provide Personal Information directly to Figma by interacting with the Services, participating in surveys, and requesting services.\nAs you navigate the Services, certain passive information may also be collected about your visit, including through cookies and similar technologies as described below.\nWe endeavor to collect only that information which is relevant for the purposes of Processing.\n\nFigma collects certain Personal Information about its current, prospective and former clients, customers, users, visitors, guests and employees (collectively “you” or “Individuals”).\n\nInformation You Provide Directly to Us\nWhen you use the Services or engage in certain activities such as creating an Account with Figma, we may ask you to provide some or all of the following types of information:\n\nAccount Information\n\nWhen you create an Account we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, personal website, and picture (“Personally Identiﬁable Information” or “Personal Information”). We may also collect certain information that is not Personal Information because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.\n\nInformation Collected Using Cookies\n\nWe collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text ﬁles that are saved by your browser when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web trafﬁc routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your browser. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties.\n\nInformation Related to Use of the Services\n\nOur servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to ﬁght spam, malware and identity theft. We also use IP addresses to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our Services are used. We may, with your permission, collect information about your operating system’s installed fonts in connection with providing the Services to you. Combined with other system information, this information could be used to give your computer a unique ﬁngerprint/signature and enable us to track your usage of our Services after you log out.\n\nLocation Information\n\nIn some cases we collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting your IP address into a rough geolocation. We may use location information to improve and personalize our Services for you.\n\nMeetups and/or Conferences\n\nIf you participate in conferences or meetup events, whether organized by Figma or a third-party, Figma may collect or obtain, and retain information you provide in connection with signing up and/or participating in that event."
