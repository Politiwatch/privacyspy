  "Most domain registrations require publishing contact-related information in WHOIS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS). With most registrars this process, by default, involves transmitting your personal information to the registries responsible for the top-level domains in your account(s). NameSilo is different - by default, we do not transmit your personal information to domain registries thereby preventing disclosure of personal information in WHOIS. Our WHOIS privacy service (https://www.namesilo.com/Support/WHOIS-Privacy) is free and is enabled by default. It is still possible for you to transmit and publish your personal information in WHOIS by explicitly disabling WHOIS privacy on a per domain or account-level basis; however, you have to explicitly request that this be done via our site.\n\nA few country code top-level domain registries have policies preventing us from protecting your personal information from being disclosed in public WHOIS - those ccTLDs are listed here: https://www.namesilo.com/Support/WHOIS-Privacy\n\nIf you choose to opt out of our free WHOIS privacy service, please review the privacy portion (where available) of the Registry Policies for the top-level domain in which you wish to or have registered a domain name to better understand how your WHOIS data is utilized by the individual registry. Also, please note that when you disable WHOIS privacy, your personal information will become publically available. This means that anyone can download/store/copy/distribute your personal information; even if you enable WHOIS privacy later on.\n\n[...]\n\nWe utilize \"Google Analytics\" (https://www.google.com/analytics/) to collect information about the use of our site, such as how often users visit, what pages they visit, and their click-path through our site.
