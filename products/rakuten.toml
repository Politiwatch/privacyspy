Sharing of Information\n\nWe may share the information we collect, including your personal information, under the following circumstances:\n\nService Providers and Business Partners\n\nWe may share your Personal Information with third party service providers (which may include Company affiliates) to operate our Services. We may share your Personal Information with our service providers that provide member support, process payments, and perform other business operations on our behalf, under our instructions and in compliance with appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your data. For example, we may partner with other companies to provide you support services, authentication services, prevent fraud on our Services, administer our promotions, referral programs, sweepstakes, surveys, perform analytics, maintain the accuracy of our databases, facilitate your travel reservations, fulfill your product purchases, administer your rewards or payments, provide a marketplace (www.rakuten.com/shop) and work with sellers to fulfill your orders. Further, we may share your information (excluding Email Data) with our financial institution partner, Synchrony Bank, for the purposes of providing rewards or benefits to you and marketing our co-branded credit cards to you. We may rent, sell, and share other information that cannot be used to directly identify you with merchant partners, third parties, or affiliates.\n\nRakuten Group Companies\n\nWe work closely with our affiliated businesses and companies within the Rakuten Group and share your personal information for our internal business administration. We may also share this information with our affiliates within the Rakuten Group for those affiliates to analyze and monitor usage and trends to improve their services and websites.\n\nThe Rakuten Group aims to provide you with a unique service experience through the “Rakuten ID”. Rakuten ID is a unified program that allows you to easily connect to other Rakuten services by a single log-in function, share your account information and join a loyalty program with the Rakuten group companies jointly participating in the Rakuten ID program. Your data will only be shared if you chose to connect to another Rakuten ID service. By connecting to another Rakuten ID service, you direct the Rakuten ID services to share your data for the purposes explained in our joint privacy policy.\n\nWe share your account credentials and profile information (username, email address, encrypted password) and related personal identification (first and last name and address) and payment information stored in our Services with the Rakuten ID services. This service is jointly provided by the Rakuten ID Services as directed by you, if you sign up with another Rakuten ID Service. As long as you do not connect to another Rakuten service, your identifiers (username, email address, encrypted password, first name, last name and address) are shared only with our parent company, Rakuten, Inc., for the purposes of operating our authentication service. The Rakuten Group may rent, sell and share other information that cannot be used to directly identify you with merchant partners, third parties or affiliates. Information that we may rent or sell will not include your payment information. If you are connected to another service with a Rakuten ID account and wish to delete other Rakuten ID accounts, please reach out to member services at memberservices@rakuten.com for a list of other Rakuten services associated with your Rakuten ID. Member services can also provide you contact information to reach out to other Rakuten Services.\n\nProtection of Rights and Other Legal Purposes\n\nWe may share the information we collect, including personal information, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) in response to subpoenas or other legal processes or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to defend our terms and conditions or other policies applicable to our Services; and (iv) to protect the rights, property, life, health, security and safety of Company or any third party.\n\nBusiness Transfers\n\nWe may share the information we collect, including personal information, with any third party in connection with, or during negotiations of, any proposed or actual merger, purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession) or any other type of acquisition of all or any portion of Company assets, conveyance or transfer of all or a portion of our business to another company."
