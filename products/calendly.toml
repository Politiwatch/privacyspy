  "**Information You Provide Voluntarily**\n\nCalendly collects the following information, either directly from Calendly Users, Invitees, or Viewers, or through third-parties regarding Users, Invitees, or Viewers.\n\n- Appointment Information. A Calendly User, Invitee, or a third-party may voluntarily give us certain information. This can include names, email addresses, and phone numbers; email addresses of other people; the subject of the meeting; and any other information provided to us or as required by the Calendly User upon scheduling, pursuant to the Calendly Terms of Use. If you receive an invitation from a Calendly User but do not wish to become a Calendly User, please contact the Calendly User who sent the invitation through other means to set up your meeting.\n- Calendar Information. A Calendly User may connect their calendar with Calendly. Our calendar integration only checks the duration and free/busy status of the events in your calendar so that we don’t book you when you’re busy. We never store who you are meeting with, their email address, the meeting title, or any other details about the appointments in your connected calendar.\n- Billing Information. If you purchase a premium version of Calendly, our third-party payment processors will collect and store your billing address and credit card information. We store the last four digits of your credit card number, card type, and the expiration date.\n\n**Information Collected Automatically**\n\nLike many websites, we and our Service Providers use Cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information when you interact with us through your computer or mobile device subject to your opt-out preferences (see Your Rights and Choices section below). Using these technologies helps us customize your experience with our Website, improve your experience, and tailor marketing messages. Here are some of the types of information we collect:\n\n- Log & Device data. When you use Calendly, our servers automatically record information (“log data”), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit our Website. This log data may include the web address you came from or are going to, your device model, operating system, browser type, unique device identifier, IP address, mobile network carrier, and time zone or location. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you’re using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you’re using a Mac or PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.\n- Cookie data. Depending on how you’re accessing our services and subject to your opt-out preferences, we may use “Cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our Website, unique to your Calendly account or your browser) or similar technologies to record log data. When we use Cookies, we may use ‘session’ Cookies (that last until you close your browser) or ‘persistent’ Cookies (that last until you or your browser deletes them). For example, we may use Cookies to keep you logged into Calendly. Some of the Cookies we use are associated with your Calendly account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other Cookies are not.\n- Other Web Site Analytics Services. Subject to your opt-out preferences (see ‘Your Rights and Choices’ below), we use third-party Service Providers such as Google Analytics to provide certain analytics and Viewer interactions services to Calendly in connection with our operation of our Website, including the collection and tracking of certain data and information regarding the characteristics and activities of visitors to Calendly. You may opt-out of relevant cookies using opt-out features on their respective websites.\n"
