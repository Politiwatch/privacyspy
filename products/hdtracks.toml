  "We use reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, because no security system is impenetrable, we cannot guarantee the security of our servers. It is also possible that information you supply to us will be intercepted during transmission.\n\nWhenever you give HDtracks sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers), HDtracks will take commercially reasonable steps to protect such information by establishing a secure connection with your Web browser. HDtracks employs an industry standard technology known as a secure-socket-layer (\"SSL\") to protect the transmission of payment information from the HDtracks Network to our servers. We do not share your credit card information with any parties not directly involved in processing or completing your purchase. HDtracks does NOT store any credit card information on our servers. Only our credit card processors maintain that information.\n\nTo help protect your HDtracks Account information, please keep your password secure. We suggest that you pick a non-obvious password that mixes numbers and letters. In addition, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any HDtracks Account information.\n\nRemember to sign out of your HDtracks Account, and close your browser window whenever you leave your computer. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information, because your computer may be accessible to others or used in a shared setting. HDtracks's Privacy Policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond HDtracks's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation."
