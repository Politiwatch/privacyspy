Agents and suppliers – We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, including our storage providers, HR and recruitment service providers, communications providers, CRM providers, marketing providers, payment processing suppliers and data analytics services providers. We do not share your personal information with our agents or suppliers except as is necessary in order to enable them to provide us with a service.\n\n2.

We may share your personal information with our competition partner for the purpose of administering the competition (for example, arranging for the prize to be provided to the winner).\n4. Event Partners – We are a ticketing agent, so we sell you tickets to events on behalf of the Event Partner for that event. We therefore need to share your personal details with them and other parties involved in the provision of the event (such as the venue) so they can provide you with information about the event such as last-minute changes, or for the purposes of ticket validation upon entry to a venue. We may also need to share your information with them in terms of sales control. Event partners can access customer information such as name, email address and a phone number. We are not responsible or liable for the actions of such third parties, and if you wish to complain about the use of your personal information by such third party then you should contact the relevant third party directly.\n5. Other reasons – We may also share your personal information with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business and in some circumstances, we may have to disclose your personal information by law, either because a court or the police or other law enforcement agency has asked us for it, to enforce our legal rights, or to prevent fraud or ticket-touting for example.\n\n7.2. We may also provide our partners with anonymous information about how users, collectively, use the App and website so that they can understand how often people use their services, the App and the website.\n\n7.3. By providing us with personal information, you consent to the disclosure of your information outside the USand acknowledge that we are not required to ensure that overseas recipients handle that personal information in compliance with US federal data protection laws. You acknowledge that some overseas third parties may not be regulated by US data protection laws and if any third party engages in any act or practice that contravenes these laws, it would not be accountable under US legislation and you will not be able to seek redress under US data protection laws."
