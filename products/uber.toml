  "6. Marketing. Uber may use the data we collect to market our services to our users. This includes sending users communications about Uber services, features, promotions, sweepstakes, studies, surveys, news, updates, and events.\n\nWe may also send communications to our users about products and services offered by Uber partners. For example, if a user has placed an Uber Eats order, we may provide recommendations, promotions, or ads about similar food offered by other Uber partners. Although we may send users communications about Uber partners’ products and services, we do not sell users’ personal data to, or share it with, such partners or others for purposes of their own direct marketing or advertising, except with users’ consent.\n\nWe may use the data we collect to personalize the marketing communications (including advertisements) that we send, including based on user location, past use of Uber’s services, and user preferences and settings.\n\nWe may also send users communications regarding elections, ballots, referenda, and other political and notice processes that relate to our services. For example, Uber has notified some users by email of ballot measures or pending legislation relating to the availability of Uber’s services in those users’ areas."

  "Uber retains user profile, transaction, and other information for as long as a user maintains their Uber account. For drivers and delivery partners, Uber also retains vehicle and background check information (to the extent permitted by law) for as long as they maintain their Uber account.\n\nRiders and delivery recipients may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in the Uber app, or through Uber’s Help Center. Following such requests, Uber deletes the data that it is not required to retain for purposes of regulatory, tax, insurance, litigation, or other legal requirements. For example, Uber retains location, device, and usage data for these purposes for a minimum of 7 years; while it retains such data, it may also use it for purposes of safety, security, fraud prevention and detection, and research and development. In certain circumstances, Uber may be unable to delete a user’s account, such as if there’s an outstanding credit on the account or an unresolved claim or dispute. Upon resolution of the issue preventing deletion, Uber will delete the account as described above.\n\nUber may also retain certain information if necessary for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention. For example, if Uber deactivates a user’s account because of unsafe behavior or security incidents, Uber may retain certain information about that account to prevent that user from opening a new Uber account in the future.\n"

  "The following data is collected by or on behalf of Uber:\n\n1. Data provided by users. This includes:\n\n    User profile: We collect data when users create or update their Uber accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), government identification documents, including driver’s license numbers and images, birthdate, signature, and photo. This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery partners, and user settings. We may use the photos submitted by drivers and/or delivery partners to verify their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies. For more information, please see the section titled “How we use personal data.”\n\n    Background check and identity verification: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery partners. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber’s behalf. We also collect identity verification from Uber Eats users who request alcohol delivery.\n\n    Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.\n\n    User content: We collect the information users submit when they contact Uber customer support, provide ratings or compliments for other users or restaurant partners, or otherwise contact Uber. This may include feedback, photographs or other recordings collected by users.\n\n2. Data created during use of our services. This includes:\n\n    Location data: We collect precise or approximate location data from a user’s mobile device if enabled by the user to do so. For drivers and delivery partners, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device. For riders, delivery recipients, and renters, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground. In certain regions (which do not include the European Union), Uber may also collect this data when the Uber app is running in the background of the user’s mobile device. Riders, delivery recipients, and renters may use the Uber apps without enabling Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect some functionality available in the Uber apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver or rental device during a trip will be linked to the rider’s or renter’s account, even if they have not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.\n\n    Transaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided, order details, delivery information, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and payment method. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.\n\n    Usage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes data such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and third-party sites or services used before interacting with our services. In some cases, we collect this data through cookies, pixels, tags, and similar tracking technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Notice.\n\n    Device data: We may collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion data, and mobile network data.\n\n    Communications data: We enable users to communicate with each other and Uber through Uber’s mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable drivers and riders, and restaurants or delivery partners and delivery recipients, to call, text, or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, Uber receives some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. Uber may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our products and services, and for analytics.\n\n    Rental devices data: We collect data generated by rental devices, such as bicycles, scooters, or other light electric vehicles or devices, when they’re in use. This includes the date and time of use, and the location, route, and distance traveled. To the extent permitted by law, the location data collected from the rental device during the trip will be linked to the renter’s account, even if they have not enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device.\n\n3. Data from other sources. This includes:\n\n    User feedback, such as ratings, feedback, or compliments.\n\n    Users participating in our referral programs. For example, when a user refers another person, we receive the referred person’s personal data from that user.\n\n    Uber account owners who request services for or on behalf of other users, or who enable such users to request or receive services through their accounts. This includes owners of Uber for Business accounts.\n\n    Users or others providing information in connection with claims or disputes.\n\n    Uber business partners through which users create or access their Uber account, such as payment providers, social media services, or apps or websites that use Uber’s APIs or whose APIs Uber uses.\n\n    Uber business partners in connection with the Uber Visa Card to the extent disclosed in the terms and conditions for the card.\n\n    Vendors who help us verify users’ identity, background information, and eligibility to work, for regulatory, safety, and security purposes.\n\n    Insurance, vehicle, or financial services providers for drivers and/or delivery partners.\n\n    Partner transportation companies (for drivers or delivery partners who use our services through an account associated with such a company).\n\n    Publicly available sources.\n\n    Marketing service providers.\n\nUber may combine the data collected from these sources with other data in its possession."
