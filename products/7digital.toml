We may also engage others to track your behaviour on our behalf. For more detailed information on the cookies and other online tracking tools we use and the purposes for which we use them see our Cookie Policy.\n\nPayment Information given over to the Payment Controller is also in part collected through the 7digital Store, including the payment method used, date and time, payment amount, PayPal username as relevant to your payment method to establish your country of origin and other related transaction details. This information is necessary for us to comply with our legal obligations to third party rightsholders of the music supplied and to facilitate fraud checks and to allow the provision of the Music Services.\n\nInformation from third parties may be provided to 7digital if you use any of the other websites we operate or the other services we support including Partner Stores that we power by way of music supply and operation. We are also working closely with other third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, analytics providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you, including but not limited to demographic information, from them.
