Any personal data provided by you as a visitor to the Website will be used only as described in this Privacy Policy.\nInformation Collected from Registered Users\n\nWe collect information when you create an account on our Website, edit your account information, donate to a project, apply to join GlobalGiving as an organization, or send or use a gift card, as described below.\n\nCreating an Account:\nWhen you create an account on our Website, we collect basic information about you - your name and email address. You can choose to provide additional information, such as your mailing address, a photo, favorite projects, etc., if you create a profile or create a GlobalGiving fundraiser.\n\nMaking a Donation:\nWhen you make an online donation on globalgiving.org, we collect personal data such as your name, billing address, and email address, if you have not previously provided these details during a prior session. We collect information about your donation, including the project you are donating to and the amount of your donation. We also collect (but do not retain) credit card numbers which are processed by a third-party payment vendor subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. If you use PayPal, Apple Pay, M-PESA/M-Changa, or a similar service, their use of your information is based on their terms of service and policies, not ours, so we encourage you to review those policies carefully.\n\nWe may also ask you to share a brief description about why you decided to donate to your selected cause(s) along with your name and general location.

GlobalGiving notifies the project leader when a fundraiser is established for their project, but does not share your personal data with the project leader or the project. Remember, however, that anything you post on your fundraiser site will be seen by visitors to the Website.\n\nIf you donate to a fundraiser, then we will also share your name and the date and amount of your donation with the person who created the fundraiser unless you elect to be anonymous.\nInformation Obtained From Other Sources\n\nWe may obtain information about you from public records and from databases like OFAC when conducting due diligence on nonprofit organization or conducting fraud prevention checks on donations.
