  "For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Non-Personal Data” means information that does not directly identify you, including \"aggregate\" and \"de-personalized\" information, which is data Stitcher collects about the use of Stitcher, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.\n\nStitcher may use tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain Non-Personal Data that does not directly enable Stitcher to identify you. The types of Non-Personal Data Stitcher may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to unique device identifier or other device identifier (\"UDID\"); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and location; and (v) other Non-Personal Data to help us enhance our Services.\n\nFrom time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Services, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on our website or in our mobile apps, how long they stay on that page, and which hyperlinks/buttons, if any, they click on. This information represents a generic overview of our users, including their collective viewing habits, and allows us and other third parties to modify information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services based on user traffic and behavior. We collect this information through the use of technologies such as 'cookies', which are discussed in greater detail in this Privacy Policy. We collect this information in order to determine which Services are most popular and to enhance our Services. We may also group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Services to our existing or potential business partners or other third parties, or in response to a government request. From time to time, we may use this non-personal information to optimize third-party offers of products and/or services. We also may share aggregated demographic and preference data with third parties to enable the provision of targeted information, promotions, offers and/or discounts on products and services. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will in no way personally identify you.\n\nStitcher may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information and data through the use of cookies. Cookies are small text files a website uses to recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to the website and facilitate the use of the website. Cookies also allow a website to track usage behavior and compile site usage information that will allow for the improvement of content and target advertising. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set your browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of our Services may not function or may be slower if you refuse cookies. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties. We do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third party ad servers is standard in the Internet industry.\n\nTracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Services are accessed. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that 'serve up' webpages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may link the information we record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we collect from you for our own marketing and advertising purposes. In addition, we reserve the right to use IP addresses and other tracking technologies to identify a visitor only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our Terms Of Use, to protect our Services, our customers or others, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.\n\nYou recognize and agree that the analytics companies and marketing partners utilized by Stitcher may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to your activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.\n\nIn many cases, we need this information to provide to you many of the Services that you may have requested. We use this Personal Information to manage and provide our Services, monitor user activity, and otherwise to improve our Services. We might ask for or collect additional Personal Information in the future."
