  "The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds that allow them to use or disclose your personal data. Where those laws apply, our legal grounds are:\n\nLegitimate interests: We often handle personal data because it furthers the legitimate interests of Flickr (or of our customers, affiliates, business partners, or suppliers) in business activities such as the ones listed below, and because that handling of data does not unduly impact your interests, rights, and freedoms:\n\nFacilitating free speech, artistic expression, and journalism;\n\nProviding customer service;\n\nSome of our marketing and advertising activities;\n\nAnalyzing and improving business activities;\n\nProtecting business activities, individuals, and property (for example, protecting against abuse of our Services); and\n\nManaging risks and legal issues.\n\nTo honor our contractual commitments to the individual: Some of our handling of personal data is necessary to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at the person's request because we are planning to enter into a contract with them. For example, when we process an individual’s personal payment data for a subscription, we are relying on this basis.\n\nConsent:\n\nIf the law requires consent, and in some other cases, we handle personal data on the basis of consent. For example, we conduct some of our marketing-related activities on the basis of consent.\n\nIf the law allows, we may be able to infer consent from the circumstances.\n\nLegal compliance: We sometimes need to use and disclose personal data to comply with our legal obligations.\n\nLegal claims: Sometimes we use or disclose personal data because it is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims."

If you choose to use your real name (or include any identifying information as part of your \"nickname\") that information will be publicly displayed through the Services. Therefore, please use caution in determining how you wish to be identified in using the Services.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically When You Use the Services\n\nWhen you access or use our Services, we automatically collect information about your use of the Services, including:\n\nLog Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.\n\nDevice Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version, screen resolution, color and depth, device identifiers and mobile network information.\n\nLocation Information: With your consent, we may collect information about the location of your device. For example, we use your location information to provide you with the option to add POI data to your photo. For more details, please see \"Your Choices\" below.\n\nPhoto Location Information: When you upload a photo with geographical data (i.e. from a mobile device) or manually geotag your photo, we collect the location of that photo. With your consent, we collect information about your location if you take a photo within the Flickr mobile application to add to your photo’s metadata.\n\nEXIF Data: Exchangeable Image File Format (“EXIF”) data is a record of the settings and other relevant metadata inserted by a digital camera when you take a photo or video such as camera type, aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and location (as described above), among other information. Unless you turn off EXIF data on your camera or device or remove it from the picture before uploading to Flickr, Flickr receives and stores EXIF data.\n\nObject and Scene Type Recognition Technology\n\nWe use image recognition algorithms to find visually similar images as well as to help you organize your photos and make it easier to search images. This technology might identify and tag scenes, actions, objects.\n\nInformation Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies\n\nWe use various technologies to collect information, including cookies, web beacons and similar technologies. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory that help us to provide and improve our Services and your experience, see which areas and features of our Services are popular and count visits, and for our advertising and analytics purposes. We use cookies to keep you logged in to the Services, to count the number of unique computers using the Services and to record your user preferences. We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as \"tracking pixels\"). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Services or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse certain types of cookies, or to alert you when certain types of cookies are being sent. Some browsers offer similar settings for HTML5 local storage, and Flash storage can be managed here. For more information and more detailed options, please see the “Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others” section below.\n\nInformation We Collect From Other Sources\n\nWe may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example, if you create or log into your account through a social media site, we will have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, account information and friends lists, in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media site.
