  "Credit Card Information. As noted above, Classy collects credit card information when you enter into certain types of transactions requiring payment. Credit card information collected by Classy undergoes a tokenization process performed by our third party service provider and is not stored by Classy directly. The information is only used to perform the transaction and any recurring or guaranteed minimum transactions to which you have agreed.\n\n[…]\n\nFor marketing and advertising purposes; for example, we may use your information to display targeted advertisements to you on our Sites and to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites;\n\n[…]\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in certain contexts, we collect information on behalf of our Clients subject to contractual requirements that limit our ability to use and transfer your information in ways that are more restricted than those in this Policy (e.g., the information be only used as necessary to provide Services to the Client and/or for other specified purposes). In those limited circumstances, your information is subject to those contractual requirements to the extent that they conflict with this Policy, subject to enforcement by the applicable Client. If your information is collected on behalf of a third party, it will be evident at the time that you provide such information. This Policy does not cover our Clients’ use of your information outside of our Services. You should contact that party directly to determine if your information is subject to such limitations on uses and to ascertain how the third party will make use of your information.\n\n[…]\n\nAffiliates. We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your information will be subject to this Policy.\n\nCampaign Sponsors or Partners. If you are using our Services to participate in a Campaign or to purchase a third party product or service, Classy shares the personal information that you provide with the applicable third parties in order to fulfill your request. You may receive communications, correspondence, emails, or direct mail from these entities; each such party operates independently from Classy and is not subject to this Policy but is subject to its own privacy policy. For example, if you donate to an organization, that organization may reach out to you to inform you how your donation was used or otherwise thank you. In some instances, we allow Clients to use our email system via the Services to contact Consumers for their current and past Campaigns, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Clients. Please refer to that party’s privacy policy if you have any questions about its use of your information.\n\n[…]\n\nClients using the Sites also have access to certain widgets (widgets are small snippets of code we generate that the Client can then put into another website). These widgets allow Clients to display activity occurring on the Sites on the Clients’ own websites, blogs, or another website. Unless you donate anonymously, your name and the amount of your donation (or ticket/registration purchase) may be publicly displayed through the activity feed on a widget. If you become a supporter of a Client on the Sites, or fundraise for a Client on the Sites, your name and picture may also be displayed on a widget. Please keep in mind that we cannot control where a given Client will embed the widgets we make accessible to it.\n\n[…]\n\nService Providers. We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf. For example, these providers may help us administer our Sites and Applications manage and administer Campaigns, process credit card or other payments, de-duplicate data, or verify identities for fraud prevention purposes. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your information and may be located wherever the Sites or Services are available. Where required by law, these companies agree to only use such information for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us unless you expressly permit them to use your information for other purposes. We now require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Data (as defined below) and who are not subject to laws based on the European Union General Data Protection Regulation to either subscribe to the United States / European Union Privacy Shield principles or agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield principles, for instance by entering into Standard Contractual Clauses, as promulgated by the European Commission. If the third party does not comply with its privacy obligations, Classy will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of Personal Data. You can find more information on the Privacy Shield program by visiting https://www.privacyshield.gov/. For purposes of this Policy, “Personal Data” means information that (i) is transferred from the EU to the United States, (ii) is recorded in any form, (iii) is about, or relates to, an identified or identifiable consumer, customer, supplier or other individual, and (iv) can be linked to that consumer, customer supplier, or other individual.\n\nOther Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We may disclose the information that we collect about you to non-affiliated third parties (with your consent, if consent is required by law), such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. An example would include a co-sponsored webinar in which you sign up to attend. In that case, we would provide your information to the co-sponsor. Those third parties may use your information for marketing purposes, such as to market products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. We also may combine the information that we collect about you with other information that we obtain from third parties. This information may help us to determine what advertisements to direct to you, to place on our website, and where to advertise our Services. As discussed in the advertising section below, you have the ability to opt-out of certain uses of your information. You also have the ability to opt-in to receiving certain information from us and non-affiliated third parties.\n\nSupplemental Service Partners. By purchasing or registering for products or services offered by third parties as a result of your interaction with the Services or use of the Sites, electing to receive communications (such as emails) or electing to participate in surveys, contests, sweepstakes, or other programs offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site, you consent to our providing your personal information to those third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. When you provide your information in this manner, it will be apparent that you are providing it to a third party. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you to such third parties in the same manner in which we have the right to use and disclose all other information submitted by you directly to us.\n\nStrategic Partners. Classy has integration relationships with third-party companies and individuals (\"Partners\"). These relationships extend the functionality of the Services and the Partner’s application or service (\"Integrated Service\") by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange Consumer data among other things and to establish linked business processes between the two. Consumers or Clients who pay Classy for use of the Services and use an Integrated Service are considered customers of both Classy and the Partner. Classy and the Partner may share Consumer or Client contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship with the Consumer or Client. The sharing of this information allows Classy and the Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and, in some cases, determine referral fees owed. This sharing may also allow the Partner to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer and allow for the enhanced functionality of the Integrated Service. Those Partners may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you to such third parties in the same manner in which we have the right to use and disclose all other information submitted by you directly to us.\n\nAffiliate and Referral Partners. Classy has referral relationships with third-party companies and individuals (\"Referral Partners\") who refer customers to Classy. Classy and a Referral Partner may share certain information with respect to a Consumer or Client that is referred by Classy or a Referral Partner to allow Classy and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared Consumer or Client and determine referral fees owed.\n\nWe also may share your information for the following reasons:\n\n* Business Transfers. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the acquiring company. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Classy will continue to have the right to use your information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.\n\n* In Response to Legal Process. We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a subpoena.\n\n* To Protect Classy and Others. We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy.\n\n* Aggregate and Anonymized Information. We may share aggregated or anonymized information about Clients and Consumers with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes. For example, if we display advertisements on behalf of a third party, we may share aggregated, demographic information with that third party about the Consumers and/or Clients to whom we displayed the advertisements. In addition, we may publish long-form research reports and blog posts summarizing aggregated data describing behaviors of Clients and Consumers on our Sites, Applications, and Services. We may also publish datasets containing aggregated Client and/or Consumer data to support replication of the published research results.\n\nThird Party Applications. Third party applications, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or Google buttons, may be available on our Sites. The owners or providers of those third party applications may collect personally identifiable information from you. Their collection of information is bound by their own information collection policies and practices. Your interactions with third party applications on our Sites may be shared with others within your social network. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such third parties.\n\nOur Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and widgets such as the “share this button” or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing such feature.\n\nNetwork Advertisers. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. These third party services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third parties with information, including both personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information, about your usage of our Sites and our Services. For more detailed information on the use of third party technologies and how to opt out of receiving targeted advertisements, please see our cookie policy here. If you would like to manage your consents to the cookies on our sites, click here.\n\nWe use Local Storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5."

  "We collect information from you so that you can log onto our Sites and use our Services and Applications. These activities provide you with the opportunity to, (1) if you are an individual consumer, donate to your favorite organizations and causes, create a peer-to-peer fundraising or team page, and/or register for or purchase tickets, events, reservations, merchandise, and/or other activities; and (2) if you are a client of Classy, set up peer-to-peer or crowdfunding efforts, create donation pages, set up registration on your own behalf or for your organization’s own supporters for events, tickets, transactions, sales, reservations, and/or activities (collectively, “Campaigns”). We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from Classy or apply to Classy’s job postings.\n\nIndividuals (and agents of individuals) who provide us information directly or indirectly by donating to or participating in a Campaign or by otherwise using our Services in an individual capacity are referred to herein as “Consumers.” For example, Consumers may enter information in order to donate to a Campaign, or someone who has organized a team as part of a Campaign may enter your information on your behalf to register your entire team for an event. In addition, individuals or organizations can use our Services to set up Campaigns in order to provide Consumers the opportunity to donate, participate, create peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns, or otherwise interact with such Campaigns (those who use our Services to provide these opportunities to Consumers are referred to as “Clients”). Relatedly, our Clients (including agents or representatives of our Clients) may provide us personal information about individuals who have registered for a Campaign being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.\n\nWhen you participate in a Client’s Campaign, we provide your personal information to the Client. This Policy does not cover our Clients’ use of your personal information outside of our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Clients, as such we encourage you to read their respective privacy statements. Further, you may be presented with opportunities to purchase products or services offered by third parties or you may elect to participate in contests or sweepstakes offered or sponsored by third parties on the Site. We are not responsible for any such purchase you make, or participation you undertake, and as such any such purchase or participation will be subject to the relevant third party's terms and conditions.\n\nWhen Clients or Consumers contact us for support or other customer service requests, we maintain support tickets and other records related to the requests, including any information provided by such individuals related to such support or service requests. We may also collect call recordings related to support, customer service, and sales-related calls.\n\nInformation We Collect Directly From You and How It May Be Shared\n\nAccount Information for our Sites. You may browse our Sites without creating an online account or providing us with your information, but to use certain features or to participate in certain Campaigns, you may need to create an account or otherwise provide us with information. When you create an account with us or participate in a Campaign, we may ask you to provide the following:\n\n* Your first and last name;\n\n* Your physical address for billing purposes;\n\n* Your email address and your desired password;\n\n* Your display name (this is the name other people will see when you post items to one of our Sites, make a publicly visible donation, or engage in other similar activities on our site);\n\n* Your date of birth;\n\n* Your marketing preferences (whether and what types of information you would like us to send you);\n\n* Information about your activities and interests;\n\n* Other profile data, such as contact information, occupation, gender, and photos;\n\n* Other data requested by Clients using custom question fields;\n\n* The contact information of a friend, other members of your team, or your customers (when inviting them to visit the Site or when you are allowed to set up an account for them);\n\n* Activity data such as your donation history, fundraising history, events attended, etc.;\n\n* Your name, contact information, and financial information, when you participate in a Campaign;\n\n* Your organization’s name, tax identification number, title, 501(c)3 or tax-exempt status, and other information about your organization, if you are a Client or prospective client;\n\n* Credit reports, if you are applying for a sub-merchant account; and\n\n* Payment information, such as credit card or financial account numbers (if applicable).\n\nCreating a Client Account. Each Client that registers with the Sites is automatically created an account profile. This profile displays the Client’s active Campaigns. It also displays the total amount the Client has raised through the Sites and total number of supporters. Each account profile may include an activity feed that displays activity occurring on the Sites related to that Client (e.g., donations made, events posted, etc.). These account profiles may be publicly accessible using the search function within the Sites or by external search engines (unless, where the functionality is available, the account profile has been made “private” by the Client).\n\nConsumer Transactions. When you make a transaction through the Sites, we automatically index it for you in an individual profile specific to you. That information remains hidden from the public. If you activate your profile, then you will be able to see your profile when you are logged in. The information in your profile remains inaccessible to the public after you activate it; in order to prevent unauthorized access to your profile, you should not share your login information with other people.\n\nDonations. When you make a donation via the Sites, other Services, or a partner website that uses Classy’s donation processing services, you may be asked to share certain information with the recipient charity(ies), including your credit card/financial information and contact information. When a Consumer has asked to remain anonymous, this only hides your name from public activity feeds, not the underlying charitable beneficiary. If you make a donation to an individual fundraiser (i.e. via a peer-to-peer page) but do not donate anonymously, then the person who created the fundraising page will also have access to your personal information (except for your credit card number or financial information). If you make a donation through an individual fundraising page associated with a fundraising team, or directly to a team fundraising page, then the team fundraising captain will also have access to your personal information (again, except for your credit card number or financial information).\n\nLogin and Location Information for Our Mobile Applications for Consumers. When you first visit any of our mobile Applications, you may have the option of creating a user ID and password for subsequent visits. When you log into certain of our Applications, we may request your permission to obtain your current location (so-called “geolocation” information) so that we can identify Campaigns near you or to provide other location-related services. In the “settings” function on your phone, you will have the ability to manually permit or preclude us from recording your geolocation information for certain Applications or features of Applications.\n\nCharitable Campaigns/Fundraising. If you are a Client, you may create a variety of different types of pages on our Sites in connection with your Campaigns (“Client Pages”). Likewise, if you are a Consumer, you may create one or more pages on certain of our Sites in connection with (i) your participation in a Campaign (e.g., you want to raise money for running in a marathon), (ii) your support of a particular charity, or (iii) for other purposes (collectively, “Consumer Pages”). We may collect information from you in the process of your creation of these Client Pages or Consumer Pages, as well as in connection with your creation of, administration of, or participation in, a Campaign.\n\nPublic Campaigns. Any Campaign (including all associated Client Pages and Consumer Pages), will be publicly available unless it is set to “private” (or similar designation), where that functionality is made available, by the Client responsible for creating the Campaign (see below for an explanation of “Private Campaigns”). Unless set to “private” or similar designation, where that functionality is made available, all such Campaign pages created on the Sites are indexed by search engines and accessible to the public. Information that you post on event pages, campaign pages, personal fundraising pages, or other public pages on the Sites can be accessed by other people. You should exercise caution when deciding to share information on public pages. We cannot control who accesses shared information or how other parties will use that information.\n\nPrivate Campaigns. If you, as a Client, create a Campaign on the Sites and select the \"private\" (or similar) setting, where that functionality is made available, this means that the Campaign link will not be displayed through the activity feeds on the Sites, the Campaign will not be available through the internal search function on the Sites, and neither it nor any associated Consumer pages will be indexed by external search engines like Google. It does not mean, however, that people cannot still wind up on these pages (e.g., if the link is shared with them).\n\nUser Profiles, Comments, and Posts. Some of our Sites and Applications allow users to create or post content, such as comments, blogs, and messages. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites. Once posted, we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. As a Consumer, your user profile, however, may offer privacy settings within your account to help you manage how your content is displayed.\n\nSocial Impact Data. Some of our Sites and Applications allow Clients to post content about their nonprofit programs and performance, including data about program strategy, operations, financials, results, and growth tactics. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected, or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites.\n\nContests, Surveys, and Questionnaires. When you sign up for sweepstakes or contests, including the Classy Awards, or complete questionnaires or surveys, we collect the information you submit to us. We use this information to administer the sweepstakes, contest, or survey to analyze the results, for research purposes, to send you other information or offers we think may be of interest to you (pursuant to your consent if required by law), to comply with legal requirements, and for other purposes as discussed in this Policy. This information, such as impact and financial data, may be shared with Partners (as defined below) to appear on their websites and may also be published and used by Classy.\n\nJob Site References. As part of applying for employment with Classy, we may ask you for information such as details regarding your education, employment history, qualifications, and the contact information of a former colleague’s name. This information is used for job reference purposes only and is not used for any other purpose.\n\nInformation We Collect From Facebook. We may provide you with the opportunity to connect via Facebook, through our Sites or Applications. For example, you can indicate that you are going to participate in a Campaign and invite your Facebook friends to join that Campaign. If you log into Facebook through our Sites or Applications, we will request permission to (i) access your basic information, which includes your name, profile picture, networks, Facebook user ID, list of friends and any other information that you have made public on Facebook; and (ii) manage your participation in Campaigns. For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Data Use Policy. We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.\n\nInformation We Collect About You From Third Parties. We also may collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you from our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties. For example, if you register for a race by clicking through our Sites, we may obtain your race time when the race is over.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically. We may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, and other automated devices to collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you when you visit our Sites and receive emails from us. Specifically, we may collect the following information about your use of our Sites via these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; webpage interaction, including cursor movement and links you click; your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address; your approximate geographic location; your interaction with the Sites; length of time you are logged in to our Sites; your unique ID which is given to each visitor and expiration of date of the ID and websites visited before or after our Sites. In some of our email messages, we use a “click-through URL” linked to content on the Classy website. When Consumers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our Site. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Consumer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. We also collect non-personal data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect directly. This information also may be associated with your username and combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you.\n\nThis data allows our Sites and Applications to function properly, including, by ensuring the proper display of content; creating and remembering your shopping cart; creating and remembering your account login details; interface personalization; improving our Sites; and securing our Sites and protecting against fraud. This data is also used to run statistics to avoid visitors being recorded twice, to understand users’ reaction to our advertising campaigns, to improve our offers, to provide a mechanism to share content on social media, to show online advertisements for products that may be of interest to you (based on your previous behavior), and/or ads and content on social media platforms or other sites.\n\nFor more detailed information on our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, please see our cookie policy here.\n\nInformation Collected by Clients. Our Clients may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Sites related to that particular Client. Please refer to that party’s privacy policy if you have any questions about its use of your information.\n\nCredit Card Information. As noted above, Classy collects credit card information when you enter into certain types of transactions requiring payment. Credit card information collected by Classy undergoes a tokenization process performed by our third party service provider and is not stored by Classy directly. The information is only used to perform the transaction and any recurring or guaranteed minimum transactions to which you have agreed. "
