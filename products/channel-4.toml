  "4.3 Personalised advertising\n\n4.3.1 We sometimes use your name, gender, location or your birth month to personalise advertisements that you see on the All 4 platform. This means, for example, that you may hear your first name in an audio/video advertisement or see your first name in a text advertisement.\n\n4.3.2 If you have opted out of targeted advertising, the advertisements you see will not be tailored to you and your interests, but they may still be personalised with your name, gender, location or birth month.\n\n4.3.3 You can opt out of personalised advertising at any time by changing your preferences in the \"Privacy settings\" section of your Account Settings. It can take up to 72 hours for the change to take effect.\n\n4.3.4 If you opt out of personalised advertisements without opting out of targeted advertising, you will still see targeted advertisements on All 4 but they will not be personalised with your name."

  "3.1 It is important that you understand how and why we use the personal data that we collect about you. This section sets out the different purposes for which we process personal data and which types of personal data we need for each purpose.\n\n3.2 Managing your account and providing you with our services\n\n3.2.1 We use your Account Data, Behavioural Data and All 4+ Account Data (if applicable) to set up, manage and administer your account, to respond to your queries, complaints or comments, to log you into your account and to provide you with All 4 and any other services that you request from us. In particular, we use your Behavioural Data to customise your All 4 homepage and the ads you see on our site, and to provide you with programme recommendations when you are logged into All 4. These are programmes that we think you will be interested in watching based on your viewing history.\n\n3.2.2 If you have signed up to access our All 4+ functionality, we use your All 4+ Account Data so we (and our payment processor Stripe) can process your payments and deal with any related queries you may have.\n\n3.2.3 We use your Account Data to contact you occasionally with service messages about All 4 and other products and services you have signed up for, for example to provide you with password reminders, where your account is due to expire, if there is an issue with your All 4+ account, or to contact you about content you have submitted to us. We will also use your contact details to contact you from time to time to ask you to participate in surveys to help us to improve our offerings. We may also use your email address and/or other Account Data to help us with database matching. For more detail about this see Database matching.\n\n3.2.4 We use your Voluntary Data to enable us to respond to queries, complaints or comments that you have and to make sure that these are appropriately dealt with, for example when you contact Viewer Enquiries. If Voluntary Data you provide includes any special categories of personal data (such as information about your health, race or religion), you must make sure before you provide this that you are happy for us to use that Voluntary Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.\n\n3.3 Competitions and surveys\n\n3.3.1 We use Competition Data for the purposes of allowing you to participate in competitions and to carry out any activities required in relation to those competitions, for example contacting you to let you know you have won a prize and using your address to send your prize to you.\n\n3.3.2 We use Survey Data for the purposes of analysing insights and information to enable us to improve our products and services and to help us to build more accurate ad targeting segments for our users.\n\n3.4 Improving our services\n\n3.4.1 We use Account Data, Behavioural Data, Voluntary Data and Survey Data to help us monitor, analyse and improve All 4 (including our All 4+ functionality). We use this data to help us understand which content and services are most interesting and enjoyable for our users and to help us identify errors and test features. This helps us to make sure that we are providing you with the best possible products and services.\n\n3.5 Compliance with contracts\n\n3.5.1 We use Behavioural Data to count programme views which enables us to pay rights holders for the content that you view.\n\n3.6 Marketing and advertising\n\n3.6.1 We use Account Data, Behavioural Data, Survey Data and Third Party Data for marketing and advertising purposes. For more information on the ways in which we do this, please see 'How do we use your data for marketing and advertising purposes?' below.\n\n3.7 Profiling\n\n3.7.1 We combine all the different types of data that we hold about you in order to build up a picture of you and the types of products and services which might be of interest to you (your Profile). We will use your Profile to provide you with a more customised and tailored experience on All 4 and to inform the advertising that is displayed to you. This makes sure that you see advertisements (including personalised advertisements) that are relevant and interesting to you. If you opt out of targeted advertising, you will still see advertising on All 4, but this will not be specifically tailored to your interests.\n\n3.8 Research panels – for example Core4, Your4 and Dynata\n\n3.8.1 We use a number of research panels to conduct market research for us which may involve collecting personal data for the purposes of carrying out this research. This collection of personal data by third party research companies (such as Dynata) will be subject to separate privacy policies. \n\n3.8.2 We use Survey Data to:\n(a) enable us to assess our performance and to improve our products and services including advertising (including for profiling and for building our interest-based ad targeting models);\n(b) inform our marketing and promotional activities;\n(c) inform and support our advertising partners (e.g. helping us to report to them about campaign performance).\n\n3.9 We may use the personal data of relevant contributors in our programme listings.\n\n3.10 Archiving\n\n3.10.1 Channel 4 captures copies of the www.Channel4.com website and Channel 4 microsites to archive data that may be of historical or statistical value and to use this data for internal purposes or to allow third parties access to this data for research purposes, for example if someone is writing a book and the data we hold in our archives is useful for that book. Occasionally this may include copies of Voluntary Data that you have provided on public areas of the platform, or if you are contributor, information about you in relation to the programme you were in. We will only ever use personal data in this way that has already been made publicly available. Where possible, when the sites are archived we anonymise or remove personal data.\n\n3.10.2 We periodically review the data that we keep in our archive and we will delete or anonymise your data held in the archive where we consider it is no longer of value or interest. \n\n3.11 How we use anonymised data\n\n3.11.1 We use aggregated and anonymised data for certain purposes, such as to report viewing numbers of particular genres of programmes and help us understand what type of content users like and to share with advertisers so that they know how effective their advertising is. When used for these purposes, this data does not enable you or any other individual user to be identified."
