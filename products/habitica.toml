  "We reserve the right to monitor your use of the services. As you navigate through the services, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to better understand how the Services are being used.\n\n3.1 A 'cookie' is a text file that this site sends to your browser in the form of a text file The information generated by the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer; however, certain features of this site might not work without cookies.\n\n3.2 'Session' cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the Services 'remembers' previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on the Services. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer.\n\n3.3 'Persistent' cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, helping to determine what areas of the Services you may find most valuable, and customizing the Services based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold personal information.\n\n3.4 You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for 'cookie' in the 'Help' portion of your browser.\n\n3.5 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and administer and improve the Services.\n\n3.6 'Internet tags' (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the Services and on different pages of the Services. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.\n\n3.7 'Navigational data' (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the Services, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.\n[...]\nWe will ask you for personal information when you sign up for any specific benefit or purpose that requires registration. Personal information that we collect may vary with each registration, and it may include one or more of the following categories: name, physical address, an email address, phone number, and credit card information including credit card number, expiration date, and billing address, emergency contact information, current medications, allergies, medical insurance information."
