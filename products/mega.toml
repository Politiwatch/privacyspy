  "\"Data security is very important to Mega, whether that is your personal information or any other data. That is why we publish our client-side browser and mobile app software, provide a bug bounty to encourage reporting on any issues, and why we have provided information in this Policy on collection and storage of all data whether or not it is personal information. For more information on our security practices, see our [security](https://mega.nz/security).\" \r\n\r\n \"We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety of your systems and devices (e.g. via strong unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing devices). MEGA will never send an email asking for your password, so do not be fooled by any such email since it will not be from us. We cannot guarantee the security of computers or devices nor of transmission from and to your device over the Internet and thus cannot guarantee there will be no unauthorised access. Also, if you lose or otherwise allow access to your password or encryption keys, you will lose the security of all your data. If you forget your password you will lose access to all your data unless you have exported a Recovery Key. Using the same password for MEGA as you have used at other sites can lead to others accessing and taking control of your MEGA account if one of those other sites is breached or hacked.\""
