We may, however, disclose your information to unaffiliated third-parties as follows:\n\n### With Your Consent\n\nWe may disclose Personal Information about you to third-parties with your consent. We may obtain your consent in writing; online, through \"click-through\" agreements; when you accept the terms of disclosures on your phone for certain applications or services; orally, in our stores or on the phone, including through interactive voice response, or implicitly, for example, when you purchase a product and ask that it be shipped to your home, consenting to our disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete delivery.\n\n### To the Primary Account Holder\n\nWe may disclose information about an account user to the primary account holder (the party financially responsible for the account). If a business, governmental agency, or other individual obtains service for you, that entity or individual is our customer, and we may provide information about you or your use of the service, products or devices to them or others at their direction.\nWhen you are the primary account holder, but you receive special or discounted pricing, terms, or other benefits through another party\u2019s agreement with us (for example, an employee discount), we may provide enough information to that party to verify your initial and continuing eligibility for benefits under their agreement with us and to calculate any associated discounts.\n\n### To Our Service Providers\n\nWe may disclose information to third-party vendors and partners who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf (for example, credit/debit card processing, billing, shipping, repair, customer service, auditing, and marketing).\n\n\n### Third-Party Carriers and Suppliers\n\nIf you are roaming on the network of another carrier or WiFi service provider, your wireless telephone number, your location, the numbers you dial, and other information about your usage will be available to that carrier to facilitate that service. Additionally, services and functionality offered through certain devices are sometimes provided in conjunction with entities other than T-Mobile. As a result, Personal Information from your devices may be uploaded and stored on their servers. For instance, BlackBerry\u00ae service is provided in conjunction with Research in Motion (RIM), and Personal Information from your device is stored on their BlackBerry Enterprise Servers\u2122. Their specific terms and conditions, terms of use, and privacy statements apply to those services.\n\n### In a Business Transfer\n\nWe may sell, disclose, or transfer information about you as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger or acquisition, joint venture, corporate reorganization, financing, or sale of company assets, or in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, in which such information could be transferred to third-parties as a business asset in the transaction. We may also share information with banks for purposes of transferring loans in connection with your device financing.\n\n### For Legal Process & Protection\n\nWe may disclose Personal Information, and other information about you, or your communications, where we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary:\n\n- To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;\n\n- To enforce or apply agreements, or initiate, render, bill, and collect for services and products (including to collection agencies in order to obtain payment for our products and services);\n\n- To protect our rights or interests, property or safety or that of others;\nIn connection with claims, disputes, or litigation \u2013 in court or elsewhere;\n\n- To protect users of our services and other carriers or providers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of, or subscription to, such services;\n\n- When information is reported to the Spam Reporting Service, it may be shared with government agencies and others that work to combat spam and prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair practices;\n\n- To facilitate or verify the appropriate calculation of taxes, fees, or other obligations due to a local, state, or federal government; or\n\n- In an emergency situation.\n \n### Co-Sponsored Websites and Partners\n\nIf you provide information to us in connection with a co-sponsored website, this Statement will apply to our use of the information and the co-sponsor\u2019s statement will apply to their use of the information. If you purchase equipment or activate service at one of our partner\u2019s locations (including websites of such dealer or retailer), they may request information from you that is passed to us as part of the activation process, but which may also be retained by the partner. This Statement will govern our use of such information, and the partner\u2019s privacy statement will govern its use of such information.\n\n### De-Identified Information\n\nWe may provide information that does not identify you personally to third-parties for marketing, advertising or other purposes.\nFor more information about our INSIGHTS Program see T-Mobile INSIGHTS\n\n### Third-Party Applications for Your Devices\n\nWe are not responsible for the third-party applications (for example, applications, programs, widgets, etc.) you select and install on your device. When you install third party applications, you may give your consent for the third party to access information stored on the device and on our network to facilitate the application\u2019s functions (for example, you may consent to third-party access to your location information \u2013 see Location Based Services). The manner in which such third-parties may use, share, or disclose such information is governed by the terms and conditions and privacy statement provided by that third party \u2013 not by this Statement. For more information, see Device Apps\n\n....\n\nLocation-Based Services\nIf your device is turned on, our network is collecting data about the device location. We may use, provide access to, or disclose this network location data without your approval to provide and support our services, including to route wireless communications, operate and improve our network and business, detect and prevent fraud, provide emergency responders information about how to find you when you call 911, or as required by law or emergency.\n\nDepending on your device, you may be able to obtain services (such as mapping or ride-sharing service) that use the location of your device. These services, referred to as Location-Based Services (\u201cLBS\u201d), are generally provided by third-parties in connection with apps or websites. Third-party LBS providers generally use your device operating system\u2019s location capabilities, which can determine location independent of our network, to derive device location. We do not share network location data with third-party LBS providers for their LBS. It is important that you understand the location capabilities and settings of your device and the privacy policies and terms under which third-party LBS are provided.\n\nIn some cases, T-Mobile may provide LBS services. Where we do so, we will request your permission before we access precise location data to support the service. If you have previously consented to our app or service accessing precise location data, you may revoke that permission at any time through the device\u2019s operating system location preference controls or the app settings. You may also follow the standard uninstall process to remove the app from your device.\n\nT-Mobile follows the CTIA\u2019s Best Practices Guidelines for Location-Based Services, which are available here. For additional details, please review our article on Location Services in the T-Mobile Privacy Center.\n\n....\n\nAdvertising\nYou may see T-Mobile and other advertisements on your devices - whether you are connected to our network or using another connection method (e.g., WiFi or wireline connections). In some cases, these ads may be targeted to your device based on information the advertiser has gathered about your prior online or offline behavior, or other data about your interests. These online ads are sometimes called \u201cinterest-based\u201d or \u201ctargeted\u201d ads.\n\nLike most companies that operate commercial websites or apps, T-Mobile works with advertising networks, which collect certain information about our site and app visitors, serve ads on our behalf, and measure their effectiveness. The advertising networks that provide these ads may place cookies, web beacons, or use similar technologies on their partners\u2019 websites and apps, including T-Mobile\u2019s. This technology allows them to track device activity over time across online properties \u2013 but we don\u2019t allow these advertising networks to collect information on our websites or apps that identifies you personally (such as your name, address, or phone number). Their use of these technologies and of the information collected is subject to their own privacy policies and those of the sites where they operate. You can opt-out of targeted ads provided by most advertising networks. Please be aware, however, that even if you opt-out of interest-based ads, you will continue to see just as many ads, but they may not be as relevant to you.

Personal information does not include \"de-identified,\u201d \"anonymous,\" or \"aggregate\" information \u2013 which are not associated with a specific person or entity.\n\nCustomer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)\n\nCustomer Proprietary Network Information, or \"CPNI\", is a subset of Personal Information that is generated in connection with the telecommunications services we provide to you. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number.\n\nFor more information see CPNI\n\nCredit and Financial Information\n\nWe collect information about your credit card or banking information, Social Security Number, and credit history for account opening, management and billing and collection purposes.

For example, we may collect information about the performance of the device, signal strength, dropped calls, data failures, battery strength and other device or network performance issues. We may also collect information about applications on your device, the fact that an application has been added, when an application is launched or fails to launch, and length of time an application has been running.\n\nTelematics\n\nIf you are a customer of the T-Mobile SyncUp connected car service, we, and our application provider, collect data from the SyncUp device in your car. This data includes driver behavior information such as acceleration and braking, speed, and RPM. The device also reports vehicle location via GPS and can report on common vehicle issues called Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTC).\n\nVideo Data\n\nWhen you use a T-Mobile video application, for example T-Mobile TV, on your device, we may collect information about the programs you watch to determine customer viewing habits so that we can tailor video selections to you or our customers.\n\nBack Up and Cloud Services\n\nSome devices may automatically upload to T-Mobile network servers information you have stored on the device and/or SIM card in order to facilitate specific functions. For instance, some devices may back-up your address book, photo album, or diagnostic data. You may choose to disable such uploads, but this may affect functionality of the device or your services. We may also provide you the ability to upload other information from your device to T-Mobile or third-party network servers. For instance, you may have the option to upload pictures, text messages, recordings, calendars, tasks, or notes.\n\nCollection of Information About Children\n\nWe do not knowingly solicit children to purchase our services or products.

If you contact us, we may use your Other Information to respond.\n\n- To develop and provide search, learning and productivity tools and additional features. Slack tries to make the Services as useful as possible for specific Workspaces and Authorized Users. For example, we may improve search functionality by using Other Information to help determine and rank the relevance of content, channels or expertise to an Authorized User, make Services suggestions based on historical use and predictive models, identify organizational trends and insights, to customize a Services experience or create new productivity features and products.\n\n- To send emails and other communications. We may send you service, technical and other administrative emails, messages and other types of communications. We may also contact you to inform you about changes in our Services, our Services offerings, and important Services-related notices, such as security and fraud notices. These communications are considered part of the Services and you may not opt out of them. In addition, we sometimes send emails about new product features, promotional communications or other news about Slack. These are marketing messages so you can control whether you receive them.\n\n- For billing, account management and other administrative matters. Slack may need to contact you for invoicing, account management and similar reasons and we use account data to administer accounts and keep track of billing and payments.\n\n- To investigate and help prevent security issues and abuse.\n\nIf Information is aggregated or de-identified so it is no longer reasonably associated with an identified or identifiable natural person, Slack may use it for any business purpose. To the extent Information is associated with an identified or identifiable natural person and is protected as personal data under applicable data protection law, it is referred to in this Privacy Policy as \u201cPersonal Data.\u201d", "note": "", "updated": "2019-09-13T21:50:54.054542+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Does the service allow the user to control whether personal data is used or collected for non-critical purposes?", "description": "Some services allow users to opt-out or opt-in to of non-critical collection or use of personal data, such as collecting data for personalized advertisements.", "max_value": 5.0, "category": "Collection"}, "answer": {"text": "No", "value": 0.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "", "note": "There is no mention of users having the ability to opt-out/opt-in of anything in Slack's privacy policy.", "updated": "2019-09-13T22:01:33.083676+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "When does the policy allow law enforcement access to personal data?", "description": "", "max_value": 5.0, "category": "Handling"}, "answer": {"text": "When reasonably requested", "value": 3.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "If we receive a request for information, we may disclose Other Information if we reasonably believe disclosure is in accordance with or required by any applicable law, regulation or legal process.", "note": "\"Other Information,\" which may be shared with law enforcement, includes all data Slack has on its users outside of customer-visible data in their Workspaces (\"such as\" everything users interact with, device information, approximate locations, IP addresses, third-party and first-party cookie information, contact information, and more).", "updated": "2019-09-13T22:04:39.944340+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Does the policy list the personal data it collects?", "description": "", "max_value": 10.0, "category": "Collection"}, "answer": {"text": "Yes, generally", "value": 7.0, "selection_description": "All general categories of collected personal data are listed, though not all types of personal data are explicitly mentioned (for example, the list might use a phrase like 'such as' when listing types of personal data).", "citation": "Slack may collect and receive Customer Data and other information and data (\u201cOther Information\u201d) in a variety of ways:\n\nCustomer Data. Customers or individuals granted access to a Workspace by a Customer (\u201cAuthorized Users\u201d) routinely submit Customer Data to Slack when using the Services.\nOther Information. Slack also collects, generates and/or receives Other Information:\n\n1. Workspace and Account Information. To create or update a Workspace account, you or your Customer (e.g., your employer) supply Slack with an email address, phone number, password, domain and/or similar account details. For details on Workspace creation, click here. In addition, Customers that purchase a paid version of the Services provide Slack (or its payment processors) with billing details such as credit card information, banking information and/or a billing address.\n\n2. Usage Information.\n\n - Services Metadata. When an Authorized User interacts with the Services, metadata is generated that provides additional context about the way Authorized Users work. For example, Slack logs the Workspaces, channels, people, features, content and links you interact with, the types of files shared and what Third Party Services are used (if any).\n\n - Log data. As with most websites and technology services delivered over the Internet, our servers automatically collect information when you access or use our Websites or Services and record it in log files. This log data may include the Internet Protocol (IP) address, the address of the web page visited before using the Website or Services, browser type and settings, the date and time the Services were used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and cookie data.\n\n - Device information. Slack collects information about devices accessing the Services, including type of device, what operating system is used, device settings, application IDs, unique device identifiers and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this Other Information often depends on the type of device used and its settings.\n\n - Location information. We receive information from you, your Customer and other third-parties that helps us approximate your location. We may, for example, use a business address submitted by your employer, or an IP address received from your browser or device to determine approximate location. Slack may also collect location information from devices in accordance with the consent process provided by your device.\n\n3. Cookie Information. Slack uses cookies and similar technologies in our Websites and Services that help us collect Other Information. The Websites and Services may also include cookies and similar tracking technologies of third parties, which may collect Other Information about you via the Websites and Services and across other websites and online services. For more details about how we use these technologies, please see our Cookie Policy.\n\n4. Third Party Services. Customer can choose to permit or restrict Third Party Services for their Workspace. Typically, Third Party Services are software that integrate with our Services, and Customer can permit its Authorized Users to enable and disable these integrations for their Workspace. Once enabled, the provider of a Third Party Service may share certain information with Slack. For example, if a cloud storage application is enabled to permit files to be imported to a Workspace, we may receive user name and email address of Authorized Users, along with additional information that the application has elected to make available to Slack to facilitate the integration. Authorized Users should check the privacy settings and notices in these Third Party Services to understand what data may be disclosed to Slack. When a Third Party Service is enabled, Slack is authorized to connect and access Other Information made available to Slack in accordance with our agreement with the Third Party Provider. We do not, however, receive or store passwords for any of these Third Party Services when connecting them to the Services. For more information on Third Party Services, click here.\n\n5. Contact Information. In accordance with the consent process provided by your device, any contact information that an Authorized User chooses to import (such as an address book from a device) is collected when using the Services.\n\n6. Third Party Data. Slack may receive data about organizations, industries, Website visitors, marketing campaigns and other matters related to our business from parent corporation(s), affiliates and subsidiaries, our partners or others that we use to make our own information better or more useful. This data may be combined with Other Information we collect and might include aggregate level data, such as which IP addresses correspond to zip codes or countries. Or it might be more specific: for example, how well an online marketing or email campaign performed.\n\n7. Additional Information Provided to Slack. We receive Other Information when submitted to our Websites or if you participate in a focus group, contest, activity or event, apply for a job, request support, interact with our social media accounts or otherwise communicate with Slack.\n\nGenerally, no one is under a statutory or contractual obligation to provide any Customer Data or Other Information (collectively, \u201cInformation\u201d). However, certain Information is collected automatically and, if some Information, such as Workspace setup details, is not provided, we may be unable to provide the Services.", "note": "", "updated": "2019-09-13T21:50:54.050630+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Will affected users be notified when the policy is meaningfully changed?", "description": "", "max_value": 5.0, "category": "Transparency"}, "answer": {"text": "Yes", "value": 5.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "Slack may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.

Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for as long as you do not delete it.\n\n\nThe Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. For instance, your public user profile information and public posts are immediately delivered via RSS feeds and our APIs to our partners and other third parties, including search engines, developers, and publishers that integrate the Services content into their services, and institutions such as universities and public health agencies that analyze the information for trends and insights. When you share information or content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.\n\n\nD.Location Information\n\n\nWe may receive information about your location. For example, you may choose to publish your location in your posts and in your Anchor profile and when you set your trend location on the Services.

If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service in order to cross-post between our Services and that service, the other service may send us your registration or profile information on that service and other information that you authorize.

Why Valve Collects and Processes Data\n\nValve collects and processes Personal Data for the following reasons:\n\na) where it is necessary for the performance of our agreement with you to provide a full-featured gaming service and deliver associated Content and Services;\nb) where it is necessary for compliance with legal obligations that we are subject to (e.g. our obligations to keep certain information under tax laws);\nc) where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate and legal interests of Valve or a third party (e.g. the interests of our other customers), except where such interests are overridden by your prevailing legitimate interests and rights; or\nd) where you have given consent to it.\n\nThese reasons for collecting and processing Personal Data determine and limit what Personal Data we collect and how we use it (section 3. below), how long we store it (section 4. below), who has access to it (section 5. below) and what rights and other control mechanisms are available to you as a user (section 6. below).\n\n3. What Data We Collect and Process\n\n3.1 Basic Account Data\n\nWhen setting up an Account, Valve will collect your email address and country of residence. You are also required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is necessary to register a Steam User Account. During setup of your account, the account is automatically assigned a number (the \"Steam ID\") that is later used to reference your user account without directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you.\nWe do not require you to provide or use your real name for the setup of a Steam User Account.\n\n3.2 Transaction and Payment Data\n\nIn order to make a transaction on Steam (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services or to fund your Steam Wallet), you may need to provide payment data to Valve to enable the transaction. If you pay by credit card, you need to provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration date and security code) to Valve, which Valve will process and transmit to the payment service provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, Valve will receive data from your payment service provider for the same reasons.\n\n3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit\nWe will collect and process Personal Data whenever you explicitly provide it to us or send it as part of communication with others on Steam, e.g. in Steam Community Forums, chats, or when you provide feedback or other user generated content. This data includes:\n\n    Information that you post, comment or follow in any of our Content and Services;\n    Information sent through chat;\n    Information you provide when you request information or support from us or purchase Content and Services from us, including information necessary to process your orders with the relevant payment merchant or, in case of physical goods, shipping providers;\n    Information you provide to us when participating in competitions, contests and tournaments or responding to surveys, e.g. your contact details.\n\n3.4 Your Use of the Steam Client and Websites\nWe collect a variety of information through your general interaction with the websites, Content and Services offered by Steam.\nPersonal Data we collect may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions and application usage data.\nLikewise, we will track your process across our websites and applications to verify that you are not a bot and to optimize our services.\n\n3.5 Your Use of Games and other Subscriptions\nIn order to provide you with services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Content and Services. \"Content-Related Information\" includes your Steam ID, as well as what is usually referred to as \"game statistics\". By game statistics we mean information about your games' preferences, progress in the games, playtime, as well as information about the device you are using, including what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.\n\n3.6 Tracking Data and Cookies\nWe use \"Cookies\", which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyze how users use our services, and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different devices and our services, as well as to improve the services we are offering, to improve marketing, analytics or website functionality.

You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.

The information generated by the cookie about the visitors' use of the website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.\nOn this website, IP anonymization has been activated. The IP addresses of users visiting Steam will be shortened. Only in exceptional cases will a complete IP address be transferred to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating the website for its users, in order to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage for website operators.\nGoogle will not associate the IP address transferred in the context of Google Analytics with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser.

This is done to improve your customer experience. You can prevent the processing of your data in this way by turning off the automatic loading of the Steam store page and of Steam notifications in the \"Interface\" section of the Steam Client settings.\nSubject to your separate consent or where explicitly permitted under applicable laws on email marketing, Valve may send you marketing messages about products and services offered by Valve to your email address. In such a case we may also use your collected information to customise such marketing messages as well as collect information on whether you opened such messages and which links in their text you followed.\nYou can opt out or withdraw your consent to receive marketing emails at any time by either withdrawing the consent on the same page where you previously provided it or clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link provided in every marketing email.\n\n3.9 Information Required to Detect Violations\nWe collect certain data that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of fraud, cheating and other violations of the SSA and applicable laws (\"Violations\"). This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation, prevention and, where applicable, acting on of such Violations and stored only for the minimum amount of time needed for this purpose.

What Data We Collect and Process\n\n3.1 Basic Account Data\n\nWhen setting up an Account, Valve will collect your email address and country of residence. You are also required to choose a user name and a password. The provision of this information is necessary to register a Steam User Account. During setup of your account, the account is automatically assigned a number (the \"Steam ID\") that is later used to reference your user account without directly exposing Personally Identifying Information about you.\nWe do not require you to provide or use your real name for the setup of a Steam User Account.\n\n3.2 Transaction and Payment Data\n\nIn order to make a transaction on Steam (e.g. to purchase Subscriptions for Content and Services or to fund your Steam Wallet), you may need to provide payment data to Valve to enable the transaction. If you pay by credit card, you need to provide typical credit card information (name, address, credit card number, expiration date and security code) to Valve, which Valve will process and transmit to the payment service provider of your choice to enable the transaction and perform anti-fraud checks. Likewise, Valve will receive data from your payment service provider for the same reasons.\n\n3.3 Other Data You Explicitly Submit\nWe will collect and process Personal Data whenever you explicitly provide it to us or send it as part of communication with others on Steam, e.g. in Steam Community Forums, chats, or when you provide feedback or other user generated content. This data includes:\n\n    Information that you post, comment or follow in any of our Content and Services;\n    Information sent through chat;\n    Information you provide when you request information or support from us or purchase Content and Services from us, including information necessary to process your orders with the relevant payment merchant or, in case of physical goods, shipping providers;\n    Information you provide to us when participating in competitions, contests and tournaments or responding to surveys, e.g. your contact details.\n\n3.4 Your Use of the Steam Client and Websites\nWe collect a variety of information through your general interaction with the websites, Content and Services offered by Steam.\nPersonal Data we collect may include, but is not limited to, browser and device information, data collected through automated electronic interactions and application usage data.\nLikewise, we will track your process across our websites and applications to verify that you are not a bot and to optimize our services.\n\n3.5 Your Use of Games and other Subscriptions\nIn order to provide you with services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Content and Services. \"Content-Related Information\" includes your Steam ID, as well as what is usually referred to as \"game statistics\". By game statistics we mean information about your games' preferences, progress in the games, playtime, as well as information about the device you are using, including what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data.\n\n3.6 Tracking Data and Cookies\nWe use \"Cookies\", which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyze how users use our services, and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons, pixels, ad tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different devices and our services, as well as to improve the services we are offering, to improve marketing, analytics or website functionality. The use of Cookies is standard on the internet. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, the decision of whether to accept or not is yours. You may adjust your browser settings to prevent the reception of cookies, or to provide notification whenever a cookie is sent to you. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. The management of the use of cookies for each browser is further detailed on the following help page: https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9076-QYOJ-0930. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to access the full functionality of our websites.\nWhen you visit any of our services, our servers log your global IP address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to the network your computer is part of.\n\n3.7 Google Analytics\nThis website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (\"Google\"). Google Analytics uses \"cookies\", which are text files placed on visitors' computers, to help the website operators analyze how visitors use the site. The information generated by the cookie about the visitors' use of the website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.\nOn this website, IP anonymization has been activated. The IP addresses of users visiting Steam will be shortened. Only in exceptional cases will a complete IP address be transferred to a Google server in the United States and shortened there. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating the website for its users, in order to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services relating to website activity and internet usage for website operators.\nGoogle will not associate the IP address transferred in the context of Google Analytics with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that in this case you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.\nFurthermore, users can prevent the collection of data about their use of the website (including their IP address) generated by the cookie, and the processing of data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in through the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.\n\n3.8 Content Recommendations\nWe may process information collected under this section 3 so that content, products and services shown on the pages of the Steam store and in update messages displayed when launching the Steam Client can be tailored to meet your needs and populated with relevant recommendations and offers. This is done to improve your customer experience. You can prevent the processing of your data in this way by turning off the automatic loading of the Steam store page and of Steam notifications in the \"Interface\" section of the Steam Client settings.\nSubject to your separate consent or where explicitly permitted under applicable laws on email marketing, Valve may send you marketing messages about products and services offered by Valve to your email address. In such a case we may also use your collected information to customise such marketing messages as well as collect information on whether you opened such messages and which links in their text you followed.\nYou can opt out or withdraw your consent to receive marketing emails at any time by either withdrawing the consent on the same page where you previously provided it or clicking the \"unsubscribe\" link provided in every marketing email.\n\n3.9 Information Required to Detect Violations\nWe collect certain data that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of fraud, cheating and other violations of the SSA and applicable laws (\"Violations\"). This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation, prevention and, where applicable, acting on of such Violations and stored only for the minimum amount of time needed for this purpose. If the data indicates that a Violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations or until a legal case related to it has been resolved. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you if the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent such Violations.

Data provided by users. This includes:\n\n    User profile: We collect data when users create or update their Uber accounts. This may include their name, email, phone number, login name and password, address, profile picture, payment or banking information (including related payment verification information), government identification documents, including driver\u2019s license numbers and images, birthdate, signature, and photo. This also includes vehicle or insurance information of drivers and delivery partners, and user settings. We may use the photos submitted by drivers and/or delivery partners to verify their identities, such as through facial recognition technologies. For more information, please see the section titled \u201cHow we use personal data.\u201d\n\n    Background check and identity verification: We collect background check and identity verification information for drivers and delivery partners. This may include information such as driver history or criminal record (where permitted by law), and right to work. This information may be collected by an authorized vendor on Uber\u2019s behalf. We also collect identity verification from Uber Eats users who request alcohol delivery.\n\n    Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.\n\n    User content: We collect the information users submit when they contact Uber customer support, provide ratings or compliments for other users or restaurant partners, or otherwise contact Uber. This may include feedback, photographs or other recordings collected by users.\n\n2. Data created during use of our services. This includes:\n\n    Location data: We collect precise or approximate location data from a user\u2019s mobile device if enabled by the user to do so. For drivers and delivery partners, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device. For riders, delivery recipients, and renters, Uber collects this data when the Uber app is running in the foreground. In certain regions (which do not include the European Union), Uber may also collect this data when the Uber app is running in the background of the user\u2019s mobile device. Riders, delivery recipients, and renters may use the Uber apps without enabling Uber to collect location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect some functionality available in the Uber apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver or rental device during a trip will be linked to the rider\u2019s or renter\u2019s account, even if they have not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.\n\n    Transaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided, order details, delivery information, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and payment method. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.\n\n    Usage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes data such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and third-party sites or services used before interacting with our services. In some cases, we collect this data through cookies, pixels, tags, and similar tracking technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. To learn more about these technologies, please see our Cookie Notice.\n\n    Device data: We may collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, unique device identifiers, advertising identifiers, serial numbers, device motion data, and mobile network data.\n\n    Communications data: We enable users to communicate with each other and Uber through Uber\u2019s mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable drivers and riders, and restaurants or delivery partners and delivery recipients, to call, text, or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, Uber receives some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. Uber may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our products and services, and for analytics.\n\n    Rental devices data: We collect data generated by rental devices, such as bicycles, scooters, or other light electric vehicles or devices, when they\u2019re in use. This includes the date and time of use, and the location, route, and distance traveled. To the extent permitted by law, the location data collected from the rental device during the trip will be linked to the renter\u2019s account, even if they have not enabled Uber to collect location data from their mobile device.\n\n3. Data from other sources. This includes:\n\n    User feedback, such as ratings, feedback, or compliments.\n\n    Users participating in our referral programs. For example, when a user refers another person, we receive the referred person\u2019s personal data from that user.\n\n    Uber account owners who request services for or on behalf of other users, or who enable such users to request or receive services through their accounts. This includes owners of Uber for Business accounts.\n\n    Users or others providing information in connection with claims or disputes.\n\n    Uber business partners through which users create or access their Uber account, such as payment providers, social media services, or apps or websites that use Uber\u2019s APIs or whose APIs Uber uses.\n\n    Uber business partners in connection with the Uber Visa Card to the extent disclosed in the terms and conditions for the card.\n\n    Vendors who help us verify users\u2019 identity, background information, and eligibility to work, for regulatory, safety, and security purposes.\n\n    Insurance, vehicle, or financial services providers for drivers and/or delivery partners.\n\n    Partner transportation companies (for drivers or delivery partners who use our services through an account associated with such a company).\n\n    Publicly available sources.\n\n    Marketing service providers.\n\nUber may combine the data collected from these sources with other data in its possession.", "note": "", "updated": "2019-12-21T05:14:24.195366+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Will affected users be notified when the policy is meaningfully changed?", "description": "", "max_value": 5.0, "category": "Transparency"}, "answer": {"text": "Yes", "value": 5.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "We may occasionally update this notice.

We collect the following categories of Personal Information when you use the Services:\n\nSocial Networking Details. Where applicable, you may sign up to use the Services directly via the Site or Application or via certain third-party social networking sites (each, a \u201cSocial Networking Site\u201d). If you decide to create an account to use the Services via a Social Networking Site, we may extract the personal information you have provided to such Social Networking Site (such as your \u201creal\u201d name, email address and other information you make available via the Social Networking Site) from the account you have with such Social Networking Site and use that information to connect to a Maple Media application, website, or property; the information we extract may depend on the privacy settings you have with the Social Networking Site.\n\nPurchase Details. If you choose to purchase any virtual goods as part of your use of the Services, to the extent available, we or our third party service providers may collect Personal Information from you, including financial information related to your method of payment, to facilitate your payment for such virtual goods.\n\nOther Information You Provide When You Use the Services. We collect information that you provide in connection with your registration and/or use of the Services (e.g., without limitation, personal identifiers including your birthday, gender, zip code, individual preferences and certain online identifiers and other internet or electronic network activity information about your computer or mobile device, such as operating system, software version and unique advertising identifier).\n\nDevice Information Collected with Your Consent. With your permission and depending on the requirements of the specific Services you are using, we may access additional information from your device, such as your general location, contact lists, photo library, and calendar. For example, to use a calendar Application, calendar permissions would be needed. For a photo editing Application, photo access would be needed. If you choose to give us access, you may also link your use of the Services with your cloud storage accounts.\n\nCertain information we collect may be Personal Information depending on how it is combined with other identifiers (for example, your IP address when combined with other data that enables us to identify you or your household). The same pieces of information may not be Personal Information when taken alone or combined only with non-identifying information.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically\n\nOur products may require additional information or permissions from your device in order to function effectively.\n\nLog Data. When you use the Services, whether as a registered user or a non-registered user, for example in accessing our Services through a Social Networking Site, (any of these, a \u201cMaple Media User\u201d), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or application (\u201cLog Data\u201d). This Log Data may include information such as:\n\nyour computer\u2019s Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address\nthe browser type or the website or application you were visiting before you came to the Service\npages of the websites or applications involved in the Service that you visit and the time spent on those pages\ninformation you search for\nother details about your interaction with our Services, such as access times and dates, your device\u2019s operating system, software version, unique advertising identifier, and other statistics\nWe use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Services and for the Service\u2019s technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to better tailor the Services to our visitors\u2019 needs. For example, some of this information is collected so that when you use our Services again, it will recognize you and serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests, as described in more detail below. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Service meet the criteria required to process their requests. We may aggregate, analyze and evaluate Log Data, and such aggregate data is not treated as Personal Information.\n\nCookies and Advertising Identifiers. Like many websites and applications, our Service uses \u201ccookies\u201d and mobile advertising identifiers to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your device for record-keeping purposes. An advertising identifier is an anonymous, resettable ID associated with your mobile device that can be managed in your device settings.", "note": "", "updated": "2020-05-17T18:24:50.513044+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Will affected users be notified when the policy is meaningfully changed?", "description": "", "max_value": 5.0, "category": "Transparency"}, "answer": {"text": "No", "value": 0.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "This Privacy Policy will be updated at dates in the future to be determined by Maple Media LLC.

Our site uses forms in which you give us contact information (such as your name, address, phone number, fax number, billing information, IP address and email address) so you can create an account, place orders, register domains, request information, and request support help. As you use your account, we may also collect support requests and other related types of information that is specific to the management of your account and Services with us.\n\nLegal Requirement. This type of information is legally and/or contractually required to be able to purchase and use Services. For example, we are required to be able to verify this type of information upon request by our payment processor. It is also required to be able to serve legal notices to you and is mandated by certain Services we offer. In addition, some Services, such as domains, require this information for you to purchase them. If you are purchasing a domain from us, we are required by law to collect and retain this information. We are further required to verify that the information provided is accurate and serve legally required notices regarding your domain(s).

Legally Required. As noted above, we use emails to communicate with you, to confirm your placed orders, to send information that you have requested and to serve legally or contractually required communications. Legally required emails cover ICANN mandated verification emails, renewal notices and any other policy or procedure created by ICANN which governs the purchase of domains. Additionally, we may be required by law to serve notices to you such as DMCA Takedown Notices, UDRP notices, etc. Or, we may deem a change to one of our policies to be material and, therefore, determine a duty (though not a legal requirement) to inform you of this change. These types of communications do not fall under any of our opt-out procedures.\n\nSending Emails: Service Communications & Promotional Communications. We also may use this information when it is important for us to contact you regarding functionality changes to Services you have purchased and/or our website and provide customer service (\u201cService Communications\u201d.) By creating an account with us and/or purchasing our Services, you agree to receive these types of communication and acknowledge that they are not optional. We also use this information to share details about new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable (\u201cPromotional Communications\u201d.) You are able to opt-out of receiving Promotional Communications (or opt-into, depending on your country of residence) through preferences in your account panel or the unsubscribe instructions contained in the email communication.\n\nLegally Required Disclosure. We will never share your information without your permission or in ways other than as outlined in this policy. The only exceptions to this are when we are required by law, in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to comply with the law, or when we must comply with a legal process. Examples of these types of exceptions are court orders, subpoenas, and UDRP/URS processes. In each of these situations, we will carefully review the documentation provided and only comply if such documentation meets requisite legal standards.\n\nChanges in Our Practices. If we change our information-handling practices or other privacy aspects, we will post those changes on this privacy statement. If we make any material changes we will notify you by means of a notice on this site prior to the change becoming effective, and we may also try to notify you through email of the privacy changes, if necessary.\n\nRetention & Deletion of Account Information.\n\nPersonal Information Following Termination of Account. When your Namecheap account is cancelled (either voluntarily or involuntarily) all of your personally identifiable information is placed in \"deactivated\" status within our corresponding databases. However, you should know that deactivation of your account does not mean your personally identifiable information has been deleted from our database entirely. We will retain and use your personally identifiable information, if necessary, in order to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and/or as required by laws or regulations. Thus, it may not be immediately deleted upon request and is an approved exception to GDPR and CCPA deletion rights. By creating an account with us, using our support services and/or purchasing Services, you acknowledge and agree to these terms of retention. Information on how to close your account can be found here.\n\nDevice Information. We collect information from your devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.), such as IP address, cookie information, so that we may recognize your devices to provide you with legal notices (if required by your country of residence), support services (when you contact our support staff) and personalized experiences on our site and emails. Certain types of collection and use may be optional and controlled via our cookie tools.\n\nInformation from Others. We are dedicated to continually improving your experience on our website. Like many companies, we use third-parties to help us track browsing, identify technical issues and provide ways to enhance your overall experience. Several of the tools that we use and what they do are:\n\nLog Files: We use information gathered about you from our site statistics via log files provided by third-party tracking partners (for example, your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experiences more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.\n\nCookies: Our site uses cookies to keep track of your session information. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.\n\nWe use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d file.\n\nWe also use cookies to store your username if you request to have your username remembered during login. That information will be used to pre-fill the login form at a later time. If you are referred to our website through an ad or a partner, we will store the referral information in the cookies.\n\nThe use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility company uses session ID cookies to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experiences more enjoyable.\n\nFor those customers in countries subject to GDPR, please see your cookie preference panel for additional instructions on how to opt-in and opt-out of cookies. The cookie preference panel is accessible once you have acted upon the cookie policy pop-up.\n\nFind more information regarding the categories of cookies we use and our specific cookie policy here. By continuing to use and navigate our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, you are agreeing to our use of cookies of described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nGifs: Our third-party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, similar in function to cookies; they are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Our tracking utility company does not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information.\n\nContests: From time to time we request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and the user, therefore, has a choice whether or not to respond and disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site and/or any other purpose that we explicitly disclose in the contest rules.\n\nTestimonials: We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email, prior to posting the testimonial, to post their name along with their testimonial. If you would like to request the removal of your testimonial from the site contact us at support@namecheap.com.\n\nPublic Blog: Our website offers a publicly accessible blog. You should be aware that any information you provide in this area may be read, collected and used by others who access it. To request removal of your personal information from our blog, contact us at support@namecheap.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information. If this occurs, we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\n\nThird-Party Product Offerings & Websites: Our site also contains links to other third-party websites, especially where we offer their products or services.

Several of the tools that we use and what they do are:\n\nLog Files: We use information gathered about you from our site statistics via log files provided by third-party tracking partners (for example, your IP address) to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also gather broad demographic information from this data to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experiences more enjoyable. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.\n\nCookies: Our site uses cookies to keep track of your session information. We do link the information we store in cookies to personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.\n\nWe use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your internet browser\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d file.\n\nWe also use cookies to store your username if you request to have your username remembered during login. That information will be used to pre-fill the login form at a later time. If you are referred to our website through an ad or a partner, we will store the referral information in the cookies.\n\nThe use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility company uses session ID cookies to help us improve our site and make your browsing and purchasing experiences more enjoyable.\n\nFor those customers in countries subject to GDPR, please see your cookie preference panel for additional instructions on how to opt-in and opt-out of cookies.

By continuing to use and navigate our sites, services, applications, tools or messaging, you are agreeing to our use of cookies of described in this Privacy Policy.\n\nGifs: Our third-party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers, similar in function to cookies; they are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user\u2019s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Our tracking utility company does not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers\u2019 personally identifiable information.\n\nContests: From time to time we request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and the user, therefore, has a choice whether or not to respond and disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name, email and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site and/or any other purpose that we explicitly disclose in the contest rules.\n\nTestimonials: We post customer testimonials on our website which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email, prior to posting the testimonial, to post their name along with their testimonial. If you would like to request the removal of your testimonial from the site contact us at support@namecheap.com.\n\nPublic Blog: Our website offers a publicly accessible blog. You should be aware that any information you provide in this area may be read, collected and used by others who access it. To request removal of your personal information from our blog, contact us at support@namecheap.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information.

In order to facilitate this communication, a registered user's email of record must be accessed.\n\nAs a service to auction houses, we keep track of communications between registered users and auction houses.

In the last case, Epik will notify you promptly.\n\nRegistering a domain name causes your contact information to be instantly listed in the public whois database. Specifically, your first and last name, email address, phone number, and mailing address will appear on a variety of whois lookup portals. This ICANN requirement governs all domain registrars, not just Epik. Over the years, many third parties have scraped the public whois data, packaged, and resold it. Epik is not responsible for this unavoidable consequence of ICANN's longstanding policy, nor are most other registrars.\n\n[...]\n\nEpik may also be required to share these whois contact details with the registry that governs a particular TLD (domain ending). Policies in this regard differ. There are over 1000 TLDs, which imply numerous registries whose products (TLDs) are sold by registrars like Epik. When you register a domain name, you should assume that these details will be shared by Epik with the registry operator in question. This is based on the registrar-registry agreement Epik has signed with them, which is how we offer the TLD to you as a customer. Registries rarely act as registrars themselves. So it is normally necessary to register a domain through a registrar which, in turn, shares the data with a registry.\n\nIn some cases, Epik is a reseller, offering some TLD through another company, which is itself the registrar. This means Epik is 2 degrees removed from the registry. This practice is common for obscure country code TLDs, which may have complicated registration requirements. In these instances, Epik offers front-line customer support, relying on an upstream provider's local country credentials. This allows you to do business with Epik, consolidating your various TLDs with 1 company, rather than creating multiple accounts elsewhere. That means more efficiency and less scattered personal information. In order to function in this way, Epik must supply your whois contact details to the upstream registrar, which, in turn, supplies them to the TLD registry.\n\nEpik is also required by ICANN to store backup information with a data escrow company such as Iron Mountain Digital. This protects you, as a customer, in the unlikely event that a registrar ceases operations. Relying on this securely stored data, another company could reconstruct transactions and continue seamless operation.\u2028\u2028When you purchase any product or service at Epik, we submit your billing information to the payment processor. Prior to doing so, we may submit such data to a fraud detection service, whose software scans the transaction and assesses the likelihood that a credit card is stolen. Nearly all e-commerce websites do likewise. It is safer to transmit this data to a reputable company that specializes in payment processing than it would be to store that data at Epik.\n\nBy purchasing an SSL certificate, you consent that all information provided as part of that certificate will be published online. In fact, that is the basis for SSL certificates. A third party must inspect that data in order for that certificate to be validated.\u2028\u2028Epik is a reseller of SSL certificates. As such, we share your information with the company that prepares the SSL for you. Likewise, if you purchase a trademark application through Epik, we will share your information with a contractor who processes the application.\n\nEpik may share your login credentials as a \"Single Sign-On\" among the platforms controlled by us: Epik.com, MasterBucks.com, and Anonymize.com. This minimizes the collection of personal information and improves the user experience, since it allows you to log in to any or all platforms using common information. All of these platforms are maintained by Epik and share a common support staff. So the data is only \"shared\" in a nominal sense \u2013 from our left hand into our right hand.\n\nSome domain names are listed for sale in Epik search results, though they may not be registered at Epik at the time. This occurs because Epik is part of a network of registrars and marketplaces that cross-list such inventory. In fact, Epik belongs to more than 1 such network. Cross-listing in this way helps you find more good domain name options wherever you may be searching. If you purchase a domain name that is listed at Epik in this way, then Epik may need to share some of your information with the company responsible for the domain listing. We only share the bare minimum required to deliver the domain to you once you have purchased it.\n\nIn general, Epik seeks to protect whistle blowers, who report misuse of domain names such as phishing. As a general rule, we attempt to investigate and resolve the matter without dislcosing the identity or contact information of the person who lodged the complaint. However, in some cases, Epik may choose to share your identity and contact information with the customer against whom you've complained. This may be done in order for all parties to resolve the matter more efficiently.\n\nIf you post comments on a public forum or blog managed by Epik, then any personal details you publish there can be read or compiled by persons, companies, or bots. The same applies to content you publish through website templates or website building programs that you may purchase through us. Epik cannot prevent such external actors from repurposing your messages and personal details nor from sending you unsolicited messages if you choose to expose your personal details in a way that allows them to do so. Epik will never obligate you to publish comments in public. Nor will Epik require you to disclose your identity or contact information merely to post a comment in public, assuming you wish to do so.\n\nOf course, when Epik is legally obligated to share your personal details with a third party, then we must do so. This might occur due to a UDRP proceeding, as stipulated by ICANN. Similar mechanisms for resolving trademark disputes exist for various ccTLD registries. Divulging your private details may also be required in order to comply with a court order in civil litigation or to assist law enforcement. Whenever Epik is forced to divulge your personal information, we will make an effort to notify you promptly regarding what personal details have been shared, with whom, and why.", "note": "", "updated": "2020-05-18T08:29:33.319571+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Is it clear why the service collects the personal data that it does?", "description": "This question deals with transparency. Even if the service uses data for reasons that aren't ideal for privacy, provided they list all of those uses, the service can still receive full credit for this question. However, if they are not explicit about their uses (by employing language like \"such as\"), a lower score is assigned.", "max_value": 10.0, "category": "Collection"}, "answer": {"text": "Yes", "value": 10.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "(1) Account Creation\n\nWhen registering a domain name, ownership and contact details are required by ICANN and other TLD registry operators. These include first and last name, mailing address, phone number, and email address. Such details are used to identify the domain name's legal owner as well as to contact the administrator in the event of alleged abuse. Epik cannot process domain registrations without this basic information.\n\nAlthough some TLDs (domain endings) require additional kinds of information beyond those data cited, for most TLDs these are sufficient. To minimize intrusiveness, Epik gathers only what we need for the most common TLDs. This core information is requested at the moment of account creation because, as a domain registrar, Epik anticipates that most customers will register or transfer a domain soon after creating an account. For a streamlined experience, our goal is to have customers fill out only one form.\n\nAdditionally, Epik relies on these details \u2013 especially name, email address, and phone number \u2013 to identify customers correctly when they contact Epik support. In cases where Epik must contact you about a problem, we rely on both email and phone, since either method alone may fail. Collecting your phone number also allows Epik to offer 2-factor authentication as an additional security option \u2013 safer than password protection alone.\n\nAs a global company, we also refer to state and country information to choose the right time of day to call. In rare cases, legal notices must be delivered by physical post to the address on file. Mailing address information is also used to assess eligibility for certain TLD registrations, which are sometimes limited to particular countries or even cities. This helps Epik show relevant TLDs to you via email or on our website. With more than 1000 TLDs in existence, we can improve the user experience by focusing on those with a connection to you based on language or location. Epik also uses geographical information to perform a statistical analysis of our customer base.\n\nEpik sends automated renewal reminders via email to help customers avoid unintentional service interruptions, additional fees, or total loss of a domain name once it expires. Email is also used to notify customers of important issues such as policy changes, outages, security breaches, price increases, and so forth. Marketing emails may also be sent to customers who have opted to receive information about promotional prices, new Epik features, new TLDs, new services, domain industry news, and the like. Notably, domain transfers between Epik accounts or between Epik and another domain registrar cannot function properly without email notifications. That is true of all domain registrars. Your email address is also used to validate account ownership and to restore access in the event that a password is forgotten.\n\n(2) Security\n\nYour password is used to provide secure account access at Epik. Your user name is used to identify accounts in contexts where you don't wish to share your personal name or email address. For example, when moving a domain from someone else's account to yours, you may not wish to divulge personally identifying information. As a pseudonym tied to your account, the user name can be a useful substitute.\n\nWe refer to your account PIN # in the event that a password is forgotten and you cannot reset it through email. For customers who have lost email access but who can contact Epik by phone, chat or an alternative email address not on file, this is often a life saver. For those who have misplaced their PIN # or did not take note of it while logged into their account, will be able to submit requested information such as a valid ID and selfie through our account with Validation.com. A link will be supplied to go to in order to submit the requested information for review.\n\n(3) Payments\n\nWe gather payment details only for the limited purpose of processing payments from you to Epik or from Epik to you. Bank information is only recorded when processing wire transfers between Epik and customers who choose to pay or be paid in this way. Details are recorded for auditing purposes, in order to match Epik's registrar transactions with bank account records.\n\nFull credit / debit card details are never stored by Epik's system during or after checkout. We simply transmit them to Epik's payment processor and also to a contracted fraud detection service. Heavily redacted representations of the credit card number do exist on the Epik system, showing only a few digits. These are used to differentiate between payment methods when researching transaction history. The redacted versions are also displayed to you inside your Epik account so that you can identify 1 card among many. Sending your credit card details to Epik by email or over the phone is highly discouraged.\n\nYour Paypal address may be saved in order to offer a more streamlined checkout process at Epik. Additionally, if you choose to use Paypal for recurring payments to Epik, we need to associate the stored Paypal address with your Epik account. Epik cannot see your Paypal password. Sometimes Epik requests your Paypal address in order to issue you a refund or pay you.\n\nEpik may store your credit / debit card's expiration date. We use this information to alert you when a card on file is about to expire. This is important to avoid payment failures associated with auto-renewal, monthly hosting, or monthly domain Rental / Purchase plans. Since the consequences of missed payments can be severe and stressful, Epik hopes to prevent headaches for its customers by warning them in advance. This also minimizes the number of renewal reminders we would otherwise send to customers. That means less email clutter.\n\n(4) Additional Authorization\n\nSome TLD registries require additional information before a domain name can be registered. For example, to use .CN or even .COM inside China, the Chinese government requires a scanned copy of government-issued ID. Likewise, Australia requires an ABN (Australian Business Number) or even a trademark number in order to process .AU registrations. Epik does not collect this information from you unless we need it to process a domain registration that you have ordered.\n\nIn rare cases, Epik must investigate suspicious activity, including credit card theft. Or you may find yourself completely locked out of your Epik account, if you have lost email access and cannot remember any of your security credentials. Under those unusual circumstances, Epik may ask some customers to voluntarily submit a copy of government-issued ID in order to prove their identity. This is strictly voluntary, and it is meant to protect customers and non-customers from fraud.\u2028 Some European customers volunteer their VAT number for purposes of invoicing.\n\n(5) Support Inquiries\n\nIn the context of support tickets, Epik relies on your first and last name, email address, and account PIN number in several ways: to validate your identity, locate your account quickly, search for your ticket within our system, and reply to you. This information is preserved indefinitely along with the messages themselves. We use it to train support staff, document abuse allegations, identify and fix glitches, and research customer history in order to help you in the future.\n\n(6) Domain Inquiries\n\nWhen someone has questions about a domain name, wishes to buy it, or wishes to complain about trademark infringement, they will often attempt to contact Epik or the domain owner. This can occur at various points on the Epik platform, including our whois lookup portal (whois.epik.com), via Epik support channels, through a parked domain page, or through a listing created by you in the Epik marketplace.\n\nWhen the person is attempting to contact the domain owner, we pass their details and message along to that owner. At the same time, Epik maintains an internal copy of the information. This includes all pertinent information: first and last name, phone number, email address, offer amount (if applicable), and message text. Storing a backup copy allows Epik to forward the message to the domain owner when the first email delivery failed for some reason. Epik may also use this data to build an internal messaging system, which allows customers to track their domain inquiries more efficiently. Epik also analyzes this data to measure and improve marketplace performance for the benefit of our customers. Also, if the person who contacted a domain owner later chooses to request help from Epik, then Epik may refer to the relevant messages.\n\n(7) Online Interactions\n\nEpik uses data related to your IP address to make our website more relevant. For example, we may try to show the local currency or language. Your IP address is also a factor in assessing the risk of credit card fraud, since stolen cards are often used by criminals in remote overseas locations.\n\nLike most websites, Epik tracks page views and links clicked in order to measure the effectiveness of our email campaigns and website interface. This automatic feedback is crucial for online companies to improve the user experience \u2013 making it easier for customers to find what they're looking for, eliminating unused features that clutter a website, delivering more relevant messages, and minimizing the number of unwanted emails we deliver.\n\nWe also use page views in Epik's support channel so that our agents can know, in real time, which page you are viewing (and which is perhaps giving you difficulty). Most importantly, Epik tracks changes made by the user inside their Epik account in order to troubleshoot errors, reverse accidental changes, and defeat hackers.\n\nEpik uses \"cookies\", which are small files transferred to your browser. Cookies allow us to provide a seamless user experience. For example, they let you stay logged in. They also help us display the appropriate language and currency for you. Epik may use cookies to track the way customers move throughout the website and interact with ad campaigns or email messages. This helps us improve the website layout. Cookies are also used to process coupon codes, which save you money.\n\nIf you believe Epik is using your personal information in some way not described above, please contact us. Our goal is complete transparency.

For information and choices about online behavioral or interest-based advertising within mobile applications, you can download the DAA\u2019s AppChoices application from your mobile device at www.aboutads.info/appchoices or from your device\u2019s app store. You can also exercise controls through the settings available to you through your device(s), such as re-setting your device\u2019s advertising identifier, selecting \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d (for iOS devices) or \u201cOpt out of Interest-Based Ads\u201d (for Android devices). Please note that your opt-out choices will only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt out.\n\nThere is currently no consensus among industry participants as to what \u201cDo Not Track\u201d means and how to respond to \u201cDo Not Track\u201d browser signals. As such, we do not respond to such signals. Instead, to opt-out of website-based third-party interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please exercise one of the choices listed above.", "note": "", "updated": "2020-05-18T17:19:15.418746+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "When does the policy allow law enforcement access to personal data?", "description": "", "max_value": 5.0, "category": "Handling"}, "answer": {"text": "When reasonably requested", "value": 3.0, "selection_description": "", "citation": "In some instances, we may disclose information from or about you without providing you a choice.

We collect information you provide to us. For instance, when you register to use the Hulu Services, we may collect identifiers and personal information including your name, email address, credit card or other payment method information, address, ZIP code, characteristics such as your age (birth date) and gender, and other information. In addition, Hulu may collect similar information you provide to us when you respond to surveys or interactive ad units, contact Hulu through customer service or communicate with us by other means, or participate in promotions or events. We may also collect information you provide as part of selecting your preferences, including within your account settings, and commercial information, such as the Hulu plan(s) you purchase. Hulu allows multiple profiles to be set up under one account, so we may collect information you provide to us if you create a profile.\n\nUsage, Technical and Log Data. We collect information when you use the Hulu Services or interact with Hulu, including when you view Hulu advertising outside of the Hulu Services. We may collect information from and about the browser or device you\u2019re using and information about your internet or other electronic network activity, including through analytics tools and the technologies described below (\u201cData Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies\u201d). This information may include your IP address, device type, browser and software characteristics (such as type and operating system), geolocation data (which may include precise location data), referral URLs, network state, device identifiers or other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \u201cad-ID\u201d or \u201cIDFA\u201d) and identifiers associated with browser cookies (see our description of \u201cCookies and Local Storage\u201d below), and carrier information. We also collect information about your activity on the Hulu Services including information about the content you view on Hulu such as series titles and episode names (\u201cViewing Information\u201d), page views, and ads you have viewed on Hulu.\n\nData Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies. Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage data and store preferences. These technologies are discussed below.\n\nCookies and Local Storage. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer\u2019s hard disk. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Hulu Services or Hulu advertising published outside of the Hulu Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Hulu Services, and to customize Content and advertising. These uses allow us to improve the Hulu Services. We may create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we can customize your experience based on your preferences.\n\nWe may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also referred to as \u201cFlash cookies\u201d) and HTML5 local storage, including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the Video Player. Because these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they are sometimes called \u201cbrowser cookies,\u201d even though they may be stored in different parts of your computer.\n\nYou can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. For information about disabling cookies or deleting information contained in Flash cookies, please click here. Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of the Hulu Services, including not being able to store your preferences or login information.\n\nWeb Beacons, Pixels and mobile SDKs. In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags, which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails, to collect certain types of information from your browser or device, check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of the web page from which the Content was viewed. We may also use or work with third parties including our business partners and service providers who use mobile Software Development Kits (\u201cSDKs\u201d) to collect information, such as advertising identifiers (e.g., \u201cad-ID\u201d or \u201cIDFA\u201d) and information related to how mobile devices interact with the Hulu Services.\n\nThe use of these various technologies in connection with advertising on the Hulu Services is explained further below. To learn about opting out of interest-based or online behavioral advertising, please see the information we have provided in Section 6 (\u201cYour Controls and Choices, Including Opt-Out Options\u201d).\n\nAccount and Profile Data from Third-Party Services. If you choose to log-in, access or otherwise connect to the Hulu Services, or contact Hulu through a third-party service, we may, for example, collect identifiers including your user ID and user name associated with that service, as well as any information you make public using that service. We may also collect information you have authorized the service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing information, public profile information, email address, birthday, pages you have \u201cliked\u201d and other account and profile data).\n\nInformation from Partners and Other Sources. We collect information from companies through which you may access or interact with the Hulu Services (e.g., distribution partners, including device partners and voice assistant platforms) or through which you pay for the Hulu Services or otherwise receive access to the Hulu Services as part of your relationship with such company (e.g., mobile phone carriers or other companies that provide services to you). The information we collect from these partners may include email address and other identifiers that support authentication, activation, and personalization of the Hulu Services, as well as payment processing and other billing-related matters. We may also collect information about you from other sources, including service providers (e.g., data licensors, research and analytics companies, and payment processors), public databases, our marketing partners, and advertisers. This may include information (whether identifiable, de-identified or anonymous, and whether collected online or offline) about your interests, demographic data, purchasing behavior, and your activities online (such as websites visited and advertisements viewed).\n\nWe may use the information we collect from or about you to better understand your preferences and behaviors, including to customize Content and advertising for you.

A similar rating is calculated for inline bots so that the app can suggest the bots you are most likely to use in the attachment menu (or when you start a new message with \u201c@\u201d). To turn this feature off and delete the relevant data, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings and disable \u201cSuggest Frequent Contacts\u201d.\n\n5.6.

You provide your mobile number and basic account data (which may include profile name, profile picture and about information) to create a Telegram account.\n\nTo make it easier for your contacts and other people to reach you and recognize who you are, the screen name you choose, your profile pictures, and your username (should you choose to set one) on Telegram are always public. We don't want to know your real name, gender, age or what you like.\n\nWe do not require your screen name to be your real name. Note that users who have you in their contacts will see you by the name they saved and not by your screen name. This way your mother can have the public name \u2018Johnny Depp\u2019 while appearing as \u2018Mom\u2019 to you and as \u2018Boss\u2019 to her underlings at work (or the other way around, depending on how these relationships are structured).\n\nWhen you enable 2-step-verification for your account or store documents using the Telegram Passport feature, you can opt to set up a password recovery email. This address will only be used to send you a password recovery code if you forget it. That's right: no marketing or \u201cwe miss you\u201d bullshit.\n\nTelegram is a cloud service. We store messages, photos, videos and documents from your cloud chats on our servers so that you can access your data from any of your devices anytime without having to rely on third-party backups. All data is stored heavily encrypted and the encryption keys in each case are stored in several other data centers in different jurisdictions. This way local engineers or physical intruders cannot get access to user data.\n\nSecret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means that all data is encrypted with a key that only you and the recipient know. There is no way for us or anybody else without direct access to your device to learn what content is being sent in those messages. We do not store your secret chats on our servers. We also do not keep any logs for messages in secret chats, so after a short period of time we no longer know who or when you messaged via secret chats. For the same reasons secret chats are not available in the cloud \u2014 you can only access those messages from the device they were sent to or from.\n\nWhen you send photos, videos or files via secret chats, before being uploaded, each item is encrypted with a separate key, not known to the server. This key and the file\u2019s location are then encrypted again, this time with the secret chat\u2019s key \u2014 and sent to your recipient. They can then download and decipher the file. This means that the file is technically on one of Telegram\u2019s servers, but it looks like a piece of random indecipherable garbage to everyone except for you and the recipient. We don\u2019t know what this random data stands for and we have no idea which particular chat it belongs to. We periodically purge this random data from our servers to save disk space.\n\nIn addition to private messages, Telegram also supports public channels and public groups. All public chats are cloud chats (see section 3.3.1 above). Like everything on Telegram, the data you post in public communities is encrypted, both in storage and in transit \u2014 but everything you post in public will be accessible to everyone.\n\nTelegram uses phone numbers as unique identifiers so that it is easy for you to switch from SMS and other messaging apps and retain your social graph. We ask your permission before syncing your contacts.\n\nWe store your up-to-date contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Telegram and to properly display names in notifications. We only need the number and name (first and last) for this to work and store no other data about your contacts.\n\nOur automatic algorithms can also use anonymized sets of phone numbers to calculate the average number of potential contacts an unregistered phone number may have on Telegram. When you open the \u2018Invite friends\u2019 interface, we display the resulting statistics next to your contacts to give you an idea of who could benefit most from joining Telegram.\n\nYou can always stop syncing contacts or delete them from our servers in Settings > Privacy & Security > Data Settings.\n\nIf you are using Android, Telegram will ask you for permission to access your phone call logs (READ_CALL_LOG). If you grant this permission, Telegram will be able verify your account by transmitting a phone call instead of asking you to enter a code. Telegram uses this permission only to confirm receipt of the confirmation call by verifying the number in the call log.\n\nThe only cookies we use are those to operate and provide our Services on the web.

In those limited circumstances, your information is subject to those contractual requirements to the extent that they conflict with this Policy, subject to enforcement by the applicable Client. If your information is collected on behalf of a third party, it will be evident at the time that you provide such information.

You may receive communications, correspondence, emails, or direct mail from these entities; each such party operates independently from Classy and is not subject to this Policy but is subject to its own privacy policy. For example, if you donate to an organization, that organization may reach out to you to inform you how your donation was used or otherwise thank you. In some instances, we allow Clients to use our email system via the Services to contact Consumers for their current and past Campaigns, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Clients.

If you become a supporter of a Client on the Sites, or fundraise for a Client on the Sites, your name and picture may also be displayed on a widget. Please keep in mind that we cannot control where a given Client will embed the widgets we make accessible to it.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nService Providers. We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents who perform functions on our behalf. For example, these providers may help us administer our Sites and Applications manage and administer Campaigns, process credit card or other payments, de-duplicate data, or verify identities for fraud prevention purposes. These third parties have agreed to maintain the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your information and may be located wherever the Sites or Services are available. Where required by law, these companies agree to only use such information for the purposes for which they have been engaged by us unless you expressly permit them to use your information for other purposes. We now require service providers to whom we disclose Personal Data (as defined below) and who are not subject to laws based on the European Union General Data Protection Regulation to either subscribe to the United States / European Union Privacy Shield principles or agree to provide at least the same level of protection for Personal Data as is required by the relevant Privacy Shield principles, for instance by entering into Standard Contractual Clauses, as promulgated by the European Commission. If the third party does not comply with its privacy obligations, Classy will take commercially reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure of Personal Data. You can find more information on the Privacy Shield program by visiting https://www.privacyshield.gov/. For purposes of this Policy, \u201cPersonal Data\u201d means information that (i) is transferred from the EU to the United States, (ii) is recorded in any form, (iii) is about, or relates to, an identified or identifiable consumer, customer, supplier or other individual, and (iv) can be linked to that consumer, customer supplier, or other individual.\n\nOther Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We may disclose the information that we collect about you to non-affiliated third parties (with your consent, if consent is required by law), such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships. An example would include a co-sponsored webinar in which you sign up to attend. In that case, we would provide your information to the co-sponsor. Those third parties may use your information for marketing purposes, such as to market products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. We also may combine the information that we collect about you with other information that we obtain from third parties. This information may help us to determine what advertisements to direct to you, to place on our website, and where to advertise our Services. As discussed in the advertising section below, you have the ability to opt-out of certain uses of your information. You also have the ability to opt-in to receiving certain information from us and non-affiliated third parties.\n\nSupplemental Service Partners.

When you provide your information in this manner, it will be apparent that you are providing it to a third party. Those third parties may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you to such third parties in the same manner in which we have the right to use and disclose all other information submitted by you directly to us.\n\nStrategic Partners. Classy has integration relationships with third-party companies and individuals (\"Partners\"). These relationships extend the functionality of the Services and the Partner\u2019s application or service (\"Integrated Service\") by allowing the Services and the Integrated Service to exchange Consumer data among other things and to establish linked business processes between the two. Consumers or Clients who pay Classy for use of the Services and use an Integrated Service are considered customers of both Classy and the Partner. Classy and the Partner may share Consumer or Client contact, account, financial and billing information, and business data with respect to their integrated business relationship with the Consumer or Client. The sharing of this information allows Classy and the Partner to establish the identity of the shared customer and, in some cases, determine referral fees owed. This sharing may also allow the Partner to provide consolidated billing services to the shared customer and allow for the enhanced functionality of the Integrated Service. Those Partners may use your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding your preferences for the use of your personal information by them. Additionally, you agree that we will have the right to use and disclose all such information submitted by you to such third parties in the same manner in which we have the right to use and disclose all other information submitted by you directly to us.\n\nAffiliate and Referral Partners. Classy has referral relationships with third-party companies and individuals (\"Referral Partners\") who refer customers to Classy. Classy and a Referral Partner may share certain information with respect to a Consumer or Client that is referred by Classy or a Referral Partner to allow Classy and the Referral Partner to establish the identity of the shared Consumer or Client and determine referral fees owed.\n\nWe also may share your information for the following reasons:\n\n* Business Transfers. If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the acquiring company. You acknowledge and agree that any successor to or acquirer of Classy will continue to have the right to use your information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.\n\n* In Response to Legal Process. We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a subpoena.\n\n* To Protect Classy and Others. We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy.\n\n* Aggregate and Anonymized Information. We may share aggregated or anonymized information about Clients and Consumers with third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or similar purposes. For example, if we display advertisements on behalf of a third party, we may share aggregated, demographic information with that third party about the Consumers and/or Clients to whom we displayed the advertisements. In addition, we may publish long-form research reports and blog posts summarizing aggregated data describing behaviors of Clients and Consumers on our Sites, Applications, and Services. We may also publish datasets containing aggregated Client and/or Consumer data to support replication of the published research results.\n\nThird Party Applications. Third party applications, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or Google buttons, may be available on our Sites. The owners or providers of those third party applications may collect personally identifiable information from you. Their collection of information is bound by their own information collection policies and practices. Your interactions with third party applications on our Sites may be shared with others within your social network. We are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such third parties.\n\nOur Sites include social media features, such as the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d button and widgets such as the \u201cshare this button\u201d or interactive mini-programs.

Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing such feature.\n\nNetwork Advertisers. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Sites and other websites you have visited.

When you create an account with us or participate in a Campaign, we may ask you to provide the following:\n\n* Your first and last name;\n\n* Your physical address for billing purposes;\n\n* Your email address and your desired password;\n\n* Your display name (this is the name other people will see when you post items to one of our Sites, make a publicly visible donation, or engage in other similar activities on our site);\n\n* Your date of birth;\n\n* Your marketing preferences (whether and what types of information you would like us to send you);\n\n* Information about your activities and interests;\n\n* Other profile data, such as contact information, occupation, gender, and photos;\n\n* Other data requested by Clients using custom question fields;\n\n* The contact information of a friend, other members of your team, or your customers (when inviting them to visit the Site or when you are allowed to set up an account for them);\n\n* Activity data such as your donation history, fundraising history, events attended, etc.;\n\n* Your name, contact information, and financial information, when you participate in a Campaign;\n\n* Your organization\u2019s name, tax identification number, title, 501(c)3 or tax-exempt status, and other information about your organization, if you are a Client or prospective client;\n\n* Credit reports, if you are applying for a sub-merchant account; and\n\n* Payment information, such as credit card or financial account numbers (if applicable).\n\nCreating a Client Account. Each Client that registers with the Sites is automatically created an account profile. This profile displays the Client\u2019s active Campaigns. It also displays the total amount the Client has raised through the Sites and total number of supporters. Each account profile may include an activity feed that displays activity occurring on the Sites related to that Client (e.g., donations made, events posted, etc.). These account profiles may be publicly accessible using the search function within the Sites or by external search engines (unless, where the functionality is available, the account profile has been made \u201cprivate\u201d by the Client).\n\nConsumer Transactions. When you make a transaction through the Sites, we automatically index it for you in an individual profile specific to you. That information remains hidden from the public. If you activate your profile, then you will be able to see your profile when you are logged in. The information in your profile remains inaccessible to the public after you activate it; in order to prevent unauthorized access to your profile, you should not share your login information with other people.\n\nDonations. When you make a donation via the Sites, other Services, or a partner website that uses Classy\u2019s donation processing services, you may be asked to share certain information with the recipient charity(ies), including your credit card/financial information and contact information. When a Consumer has asked to remain anonymous, this only hides your name from public activity feeds, not the underlying charitable beneficiary. If you make a donation to an individual fundraiser (i.e. via a peer-to-peer page) but do not donate anonymously, then the person who created the fundraising page will also have access to your personal information (except for your credit card number or financial information). If you make a donation through an individual fundraising page associated with a fundraising team, or directly to a team fundraising page, then the team fundraising captain will also have access to your personal information (again, except for your credit card number or financial information).\n\nLogin and Location Information for Our Mobile Applications for Consumers. When you first visit any of our mobile Applications, you may have the option of creating a user ID and password for subsequent visits. When you log into certain of our Applications, we may request your permission to obtain your current location (so-called \u201cgeolocation\u201d information) so that we can identify Campaigns near you or to provide other location-related services. In the \u201csettings\u201d function on your phone, you will have the ability to manually permit or preclude us from recording your geolocation information for certain Applications or features of Applications.\n\nCharitable Campaigns/Fundraising. If you are a Client, you may create a variety of different types of pages on our Sites in connection with your Campaigns (\u201cClient Pages\u201d). Likewise, if you are a Consumer, you may create one or more pages on certain of our Sites in connection with (i) your participation in a Campaign (e.g., you want to raise money for running in a marathon), (ii) your support of a particular charity, or (iii) for other purposes (collectively, \u201cConsumer Pages\u201d). We may collect information from you in the process of your creation of these Client Pages or Consumer Pages, as well as in connection with your creation of, administration of, or participation in, a Campaign.\n\nPublic Campaigns. Any Campaign (including all associated Client Pages and Consumer Pages), will be publicly available unless it is set to \u201cprivate\u201d (or similar designation), where that functionality is made available, by the Client responsible for creating the Campaign (see below for an explanation of \u201cPrivate Campaigns\u201d). Unless set to \u201cprivate\u201d or similar designation, where that functionality is made available, all such Campaign pages created on the Sites are indexed by search engines and accessible to the public. Information that you post on event pages, campaign pages, personal fundraising pages, or other public pages on the Sites can be accessed by other people. You should exercise caution when deciding to share information on public pages. We cannot control who accesses shared information or how other parties will use that information.\n\nPrivate Campaigns. If you, as a Client, create a Campaign on the Sites and select the \"private\" (or similar) setting, where that functionality is made available, this means that the Campaign link will not be displayed through the activity feeds on the Sites, the Campaign will not be available through the internal search function on the Sites, and neither it nor any associated Consumer pages will be indexed by external search engines like Google. It does not mean, however, that people cannot still wind up on these pages (e.g., if the link is shared with them).\n\nUser Profiles, Comments, and Posts. Some of our Sites and Applications allow users to create or post content, such as comments, blogs, and messages. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites. Once posted, we cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law, or your personal privacy. As a Consumer, your user profile, however, may offer privacy settings within your account to help you manage how your content is displayed.\n\nSocial Impact Data. Some of our Sites and Applications allow Clients to post content about their nonprofit programs and performance, including data about program strategy, operations, financials, results, and growth tactics. If you provide content to our Sites, we may collect and use that information as described in this Policy. Please note that such information may be viewed, collected, or used by other registered users and public visitors to our Sites.\n\nContests, Surveys, and Questionnaires. When you sign up for sweepstakes or contests, including the Classy Awards, or complete questionnaires or surveys, we collect the information you submit to us. We use this information to administer the sweepstakes, contest, or survey to analyze the results, for research purposes, to send you other information or offers we think may be of interest to you (pursuant to your consent if required by law), to comply with legal requirements, and for other purposes as discussed in this Policy. This information, such as impact and financial data, may be shared with Partners (as defined below) to appear on their websites and may also be published and used by Classy.\n\nJob Site References. As part of applying for employment with Classy, we may ask you for information such as details regarding your education, employment history, qualifications, and the contact information of a former colleague\u2019s name. This information is used for job reference purposes only and is not used for any other purpose.\n\nInformation We Collect From Facebook. We may provide you with the opportunity to connect via Facebook, through our Sites or Applications. For example, you can indicate that you are going to participate in a Campaign and invite your Facebook friends to join that Campaign. If you log into Facebook through our Sites or Applications, we will request permission to (i) access your basic information, which includes your name, profile picture, networks, Facebook user ID, list of friends and any other information that you have made public on Facebook; and (ii) manage your participation in Campaigns. For information about how Facebook may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult the Facebook Data Use Policy. We have no control over how Facebook uses or discloses the personal information you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from Facebook along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.\n\nInformation We Collect About You From Third Parties. We also may collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you from our affiliates and non-affiliated third parties. For example, if you register for a race by clicking through our Sites, we may obtain your race time when the race is over.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically. We may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, and other automated devices to collect information, including personally identifiable information, about you when you visit our Sites and receive emails from us. Specifically, we may collect the following information about your use of our Sites via these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; webpage interaction, including cursor movement and links you click; your Internet Protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address; your approximate geographic location; your interaction with the Sites; length of time you are logged in to our Sites; your unique ID which is given to each visitor and expiration of date of the ID and websites visited before or after our Sites. In some of our email messages, we use a \u201cclick-through URL\u201d linked to content on the Classy website. When Consumers click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate web server before arriving at the destination page on our Site. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our Consumer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click text or graphic links in the email messages. We also collect non-personal data (including, without limitation, of the type set forth above) from third parties. The information we collect from third parties may be combined with the information we collect directly. This information also may be associated with your username and combined with other information, including personally identifiable information that we collect about you.\n\nThis data allows our Sites and Applications to function properly, including, by ensuring the proper display of content; creating and remembering your shopping cart; creating and remembering your account login details; interface personalization; improving our Sites; and securing our Sites and protecting against fraud. This data is also used to run statistics to avoid visitors being recorded twice, to understand users\u2019 reaction to our advertising campaigns, to improve our offers, to provide a mechanism to share content on social media, to show online advertisements for products that may be of interest to you (based on your previous behavior), and/or ads and content on social media platforms or other sites.\n\nFor more detailed information on our use of cookies and other tracking technologies, please see our cookie policy here.\n\nInformation Collected by Clients. Our Clients may place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Sites related to that particular Client. Please refer to that party\u2019s privacy policy if you have any questions about its use of your information.\n\nCredit Card Information. As noted above, Classy collects credit card information when you enter into certain types of transactions requiring payment. Credit card information collected by Classy undergoes a tokenization process performed by our third party service provider and is not stored by Classy directly. The information is only used to perform the transaction and any recurring or guaranteed minimum transactions to which you have agreed.

We may store copies of Interfacing Software that you provide to Plex and that accesses or calls any software provided by Plex as part of the Services.\nYou may send us logs, metadata, or other information about your devices, media, and experiences for the purpose of resolving an issue you may have with the software or suggesting desired features. On client applications where it is possible, we will offer the ability to opt-out of sending crash reports. If you would like to learn more about the information being sent in crash reports, we encourage you to review the privacy policies for the third-party client applications you are using to access Plex Services. The information being sent to us will only be used to help resolve your issue and / or improve our Services, and using our Services and provision of such information, you agree to such use by us.\nLike many online services, we may collect information about the devices that are used to access our Services, such as the IP address of the device, the operating system and version of the device, the browser that you use to access a Plex web page, and the versions of the Plex technologies being used. We may also collect location information about the devices that access our Services.\nWhen a request for information or content is sent to a Plex Media Server, we may collect an application identifier that identifies which application sent the request. An application identifier uniquely identifies a particular copy of an application. For example, if you download an application from Plex, fully uninstall the copy of the application, and then re-download the application from Plex, the new copy of the application will be associated with a different application identifier than the uninstalled copy of the application. Note that simply deleting the app without fully uninstalling may not reset the application identifier.\nWe may provide, and you may choose to use, the Plex Relay Service to connect or stream your Personal Content to another device. If you choose to use the Plex Relay Service, we will transfer the data necessary to perform the service. All such traffic is encrypted from end-to-end in a manner that makes it impossible for Plex or the Plex Relay Service to decrypt or view any data. The data transferred via the Plex Relay Service is not stored by Plex except for the temporary buffering of data required to provide you with an optimal streaming experience. You can disable the Plex Relay Service by turning off Remote Access in your server settings.\nLike many online services, Plex uses cookies, tracking pixels, and similar technologies to collect information that helps us provide our Services to you. We also use these technologies to help market our products and services to you and other customers.

We use the email address associated with the Registered Name for this purpose. Tucows sends this email directly and does not use a third party service to facilitate this mailing.\n\nIf your Registered Domain Name is the subject of a dispute under either ICANN\u2019s Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy or its Uniform Rapid Suspension Policy, we will share your registration data with the arbitration provider that is adjudicating the dispute, who will share it with the other party to the dispute.

In that case, we may provide your Personal Data to the Third Party Organizers on behalf of the Organizers. The same is true for contests and sweepstakes: we may provide your Personal Data to both the Organizer promoting the contest or sweepstakes, and any legal sponsor of the contest or sweepstakes (such as a brand sponsor).\n\nWe are not responsible for the actions of these Organizers, or their Third Party Organizers (or other downstream recipients of your Personal Data), with respect to your Personal Data. It is important that you review the applicable policies of the Organizers, and if applicable and available, their appointed Third Party Organizers, of an event (and the related fundraising page, if applicable) before providing Personal Data or other information in connection with that event or related fundraising page.\n\nSimilarly, if you are a member of an Organizer's organization within Eventbrite, your Personal Data will be available to the Organizer and shared with those Third Party Organizers granted permission by the Organizer to view all members of the Organizer's organization.\n\na. Connecting Your Eventbrite Account to Social Media Services. You can connect your Eventbrite account to your accounts on third party services like Facebook, in which case we may collect, use, disclose, transfer and store/retain information relating to your account with such third party services in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you connect with Facebook, we store your Facebook id, first name, last name, email, location, friends list and profile picture and use them to connect with your Facebook account to provide certain functionality on the Services, like recommending events that your Facebook friends are interested in and sharing the events you are interested in, or attending, with certain groups of people like your Facebook friends.\n\nb. \u201cLiking\u201d or \u201cFollowing\u201d Eventbrite on Social Media. In addition, when you \u201clike\u201d or \u201cfollow\u201d us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter or other social media sites (to the extent we provide that capability), we may collect some information from you including your name, email address, and any comments or content you post relevant to us. We likewise may collect your information if you sign up for one of our promotions or submit information to us through social media sites.\n\nc. Facebook Plug-Ins and Links on Our Pages. Eventbrite\u2019s own website may contain links to Facebook as well, such as through the Facebook \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cShare\u201d button or other social plug-ins. When you interact with these features and links, your browser will establish a direct link with the Facebook servers, and Facebook will receive information about your browser and activity, and may link it to your Facebook user account. For more information about how Facebook uses data, please see Facebook\u2019s own policies.\n\nd. Additional Facebook Marketing and Connectivity. In addition, if you are a member of Facebook (or another social media platform), and you provide Personal Data to an Organizer (such as in the ways described in Section 5.5), the Organizer may use that Personal Data to send you advertising and offers through Facebook (or another social media) platform, including when you are on Facebook or another social media platform. The Organizer may work with us and with third parties to enable this data integration and advertising. Facebook and other social media platforms may provide a way to opt out of this type of advertising. Please review their user settings and support pages to learn more about how they help you to manage privacy and marketing choices.\n\ne. Third party services and integrations. Eventbrite may provide you with opportunities to contract directly with third parties, and/or to integrate with third party services or applications, through our platform. In such instances, we will disclose your Personal Data to other entities in order to fulfill a request by you, or to provide services you have requested.\n\nWe may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law in order to (for example) respond to a subpoena or request from law enforcement, a court or a government agency (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect or defend our rights, interests or property or that of third parties, (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Services, (d) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users of the Services or the public, or (e) protect against legal liability.\n", "note": "", "updated": "2020-06-02T08:48:47.690307+00:00"}}, {"question": {"text": "Is it clear why the service collects the personal data that it does?", "description": "This question deals with transparency.

We may use the Personal Data as follows:\n\n4.1 Specific Reason.\n\nIf you provide Personal Data for a certain purpose, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the purpose for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem and will respond to the email address from which the contact came.\n\n4.2 Access and Use.\n\nIf you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to or use of the Services or any functionality thereof, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to or use of the Services or functionality and to analyze your use of such Services or functionality. For instance, if you supply Personal Data relating to your identity or qualifications to use certain portions of the Services, we will use that information to make a decision as to granting you access to use such Services and to assess your ongoing qualification to use such Services.\n\n4.3 Internal Business Purposes.\n\nWe may use your Personal Data for internal business purposes, including without limitation, to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our Users, to improve the Services, to protect against, identify or address wrongdoing, to enforce our Terms of Service, to manage your account and provide you with customer service, and to generally manage the Services and our business.\n\n4.4 Eventbrite Marketing.\n\nWe may use your Personal Data for our marketing and advertising purposes, including (without limitation) by email, SMS marketing, display media, and targeting other devices (such as tablets, mobile devices and televisions). We do this in order to inform you about services or events we believe might be of interest to you, develop promotional or marketing materials and display Eventbrite or event-related content and advertising on or off the Services that we believe might be of interest to you. We may also do this on behalf of an Organizer, for example where your prior interactions with an Organizer suggest you may be interested in a particular type of event. See \"Opt Out from Electronic Communications\" below on how to opt out of various Eventbrite marketing communications.\n\nYou may see advertisements for our Services (or our Organizer\u2019s events) on third party websites, including on social media platforms. Where you see an advertisement on a third party website or social media platform, this may be because we engaged the third party or social media platform to show this advertisement to our Users, or to others who have similar attributes to our Users. In some cases, this involves sharing your email address or other contact details with the third party or social media platform so that they can identify you as one of our Users, or identify other individuals with similar attributes to you in order to show them advertisements for our Services (or for our Organizer\u2019s events). If you no longer want your Personal Data to be used for these purposes please contact us at privacy@eventbrite.com. For more information about how we market on, and interact with social media sites, please refer to section 5.6.\n\n4.5 Organizer Emails.\n\nWe allow Organizers to use our email tools to contact Consumers for their current and past events, so you may receive emails from our system that originate with such Organizers and that we send on their behalf. If you registered for an event on the Services, your email address is available to that Organizer. However, Organizers may also import the email addresses they have from external sources and send communications through the Services to those email addresses, and we will deliver those communications to those email addresses on the Organizer's behalf. The Organizer and not Eventbrite is responsible for sending these emails. See \"Opt Out from Electronic Communications\" below on how to opt out of Organizer-initiated communications.\n\n4.6 Use of Interest-Based Data\n\nWe sometimes make inferences about the type of events or activities you may be interested in. We may use these inferences to help target advertising or customize recommendations to you, including on behalf of Organizers. We may do this on an aggregated or generalized basis. For instance, we may determine that our users who attend many comedy events also often attend or show interest in endurance-related events or content. We may direct (or assist in directing) content or recommendations related to both comedy and endurance to those Users.\n\n4.7 Other Purposes.\n\nIf we intend to use any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time the Personal Data is collected or we will obtain your consent subsequent to such collection but prior to such use.\n\n4.8 Aggregated Personal Data.\n\nIn an ongoing effort to understand and serve our Users better, we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research is typically conducted on an aggregate basis only that does not identify you.

Sometimes this will be on our own behalf and other times this will be on behalf of an Organizer using our Services to run an event.

The Personal Data we may collect includes without limitation your name, address, email address and any other information that you choose to provide and/or that enables Users to be personally identified.\n\nInformation we automatically collect: We also automatically collect certain technical data that is sent to us from the computer, mobile device and/or browser through which you access the Services (\"Automatic Data\"). Automatic Data, includes without limitation, a unique identifier associated with your access device and/or browser (including, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address) characteristics about your access device and/or browser, statistics on your activities on the Services, information about how you came to the Services and data collected through Cookies, Pixel Tags, Local Shared Objects, Web Storage and other similar technologies. You can find out more information about how we use Cookies and other similar tracking technologies in our Cookie Statement.\n\nWhen you register for the Services or otherwise submit Personal Data to us, we may associate other Non-Personal Data (including Non-Personal Data we collect from third parties) with your Personal Data. At such instance, we will treat any such combined data as your Personal Data until such time as it can no longer be associated with you or used to identify you.\n\n3.2 Information Collected From Organizers.\n\nIf you are an Organizer we will collect additional Personal Data from you.\n\nInformation you provide to us: In some cases, we may collect your credit card information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.), some of which may constitute Personal Data, to secure certain payments. In addition, if you use our payment processing services, we will collect financial information from you (e.g., your bank account information or an address to send checks) as necessary to facilitate payments and information required for tax purposes (e.g., your taxpayer identification number).\n\nInformation we obtain from other sources: We may also collect or receive Personal Data including your name, email address and other contact information from third party sources, such as third party websites and marketing partners, your bank, our payment processing partners and credit reporting agencies.\n\n3.3 Information Collected From Consumers.\n\nIf you are a Consumer we will collect additional Personal Data from you, sometimes for our own purposes and other times on behalf of an Organizer (see Section 16 below for more information).\n\nInformation you provide via Eventbrite Properties or Applications: If you register for a paid event, you will provide financial information (e.g., your credit card number and expiration date, billing address, etc.) some of which may constitute Personal Data. In addition, Organizers can set up event registration pages to collect virtually any information from Consumers in connection with registration for an Organizer's event listed on the Services. Eventbrite does not control an Organizer's registration process nor the Personal Data that they collect. When you register for, or otherwise provide information to Eventbrite in conjunction with an Organizer event or activity, whether that information is yours or a third party\u2019s, in connection with a purchase, registration, or transfer, that Organizer will receive and may use the information you provide.

We rely on a number of legal bases to use your information in these ways. These legal bases include where:\n\nNecessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Use and in order to provide the Services to you;\nYou have consented to the processing, which you can revoke at any time;\nNecessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend any impending or asserted legal claims;\nNecessary for the purposes of our or a third party\u2019s legitimate interests, such as those of visitors, members, or partners (described in more detail below);\nYou have expressly made the information public;\nNecessary in the public interest, such as to prevent crime; and\nOccasionally necessary to protect your vital interests or those of others (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury).\nWe principally rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at anytime) (i) to send marketing messages, (ii) for third-party data sharing related to advertising, and, to the extent applicable, (iii) for the use of location data for advertising purposes.\n\nWe rely on consent for targeted online and offline marketing including through tools like Facebook Custom Audience and Google Customer Match. We or our sellers may advertise our Services or our sellers\u2019 products through a variety of different mediums and rely on your consent to do so off-site. As part of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook, Google, and other partners disclosed in our Cookies and Similar Technology Policy. These partners have their own privacy policies and consent mechanisms for their customers, in addition to Etsy\u2019s controls. You may see the privacy policies and privacy choices for these partners, and the information you share with them, in our Cookies and Similar Technology Disclosures.\n\nOur Legitimate Interests\n\nWhere we process your information on the basis of legitimate interests, we do so as follows:\n\nProviding and Improving our Services: We use your information to improve and customize our Services, including sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so as it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests of improving our Services for our users. This is also necessary to enable us to pursue our legitimate interests in understanding how our Services are being used, and to explore and unlock ways to develop and grow our business. It is also necessary to allow us to pursue our legitimate interests in improving our Services, efficiency, interest in Services for users, and obtaining insights into usage patterns of our Services. As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on Etsy.\n\nProviding Marketing Communications: We rely on our legitimate interest to send you marketing messages (where permitted independent of consent) and for Etsy's advertising programs (including Etsy\u2019s on-site advertising and marketing).\n\nKeeping our Services Safe and Secure: We use your information for safety and security purposes, which can include sharing your information for such purposes, and we do so because it is necessary to pursue our legitimate interests or those of a third party in ensuring the security of our Services, preventing harm to individuals or property, or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage to Etsy\u2019s systems, or those of our users or our partners. This includes enhancing protection of our community against spam, harassment, intellectual property infringement, crime, and security risks of all kinds. We use your information to provide and improve the Services, for billing and payments, for identification and authentication, and for general research and aggregate reporting. For example, in accordance with our existing case resolution process, we may use information you provide to resolve disputes with Etsy or other members.\n\nBuying and Selling: As part of the buying and selling process, Etsy will facilitate the sharing of information between the two members involved in the transaction, such as the other Etsy member's shipping address and payment status. This can also involve us sharing your information with some of our third party partners such as our shipping and payment partners to enable us to provide the Service to you. Such partners will process your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. In some instances, while they are subject to Etsy\u2019s privacy and security requirements for vendors, these partners, not Etsy, are responsible for the protection of personal information under their control. By making a sale or a purchase on Etsy, you are directing us to share your information in this way. Since this is an important part of the Services we provide, we need to do this in order to perform our obligations under our Terms of Use. We expect you to respect the privacy of the member whose information you have received. As described in Etsy's Terms of Use, you have a limited license to use that information only for Etsy-related communications or for Etsy-facilitated transactions. Etsy has not granted a license to you to use the information for unauthorized transactions or sending unsolicited commercial messages in violation of any applicable laws, including any consent requirements of the jurisdiction of the recipient. You should only add a member to your email or physical mailing list or otherwise use or store a member\u2019s personal information in accordance with applicable laws, including any consent requirements that apply in that member's jurisdiction.\n\nSite Customization: We may learn about the types of products that you\u2019re interested in from your browsing and purchasing behavior on (and off) the Site or Apps and use such information to suggest potential purchases as a result. As a core part of our Services, we have a legitimate interest in customizing your on-site experience to help you search for and discover relevant items and recommended purchases, including using this information to help sellers find the best ways to market and sell their products on Etsy.\n\nLegal and Safety: Etsy may also retain, preserve, or release your personal information to a third party in the following limited circumstances: in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet legitimate national security or law enforcement requirements; to protect, establish, or exercise our legal rights or defend against impending or asserted legal claims, including to collect a debt, or a material violation of our policies (including our Intellectual Property Policy); to comply with a subpoena, court order, legal process, or other legal requirement; or when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, threats to our rights or property, or violations of Etsy's Terms of Use. In these cases, our use of your information may be necessary for the purposes of our or a third party\u2019s legitimate interest in keeping our Services secure, preventing harm or crime, enforcing or defending legal rights, or preventing damage. Such use may also be necessary to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or to exercise or defend legal claims. It may also be necessary in the public interest (such as to prevent crime) or to protect vital interests (in rare cases where we may need to share information to prevent loss of life or personal injury).\n\nIf Etsy receives a lawful, verified request for a member\u2019s records or information in one of the limited circumstances described in the previous paragraph, Etsy may disclose personal information, which may include, but may not be limited to, a member\u2019s name, address, phone number, email address, and company name. Find out more about how Etsy responds to requests for records or information about members of Etsy\u2019s community in our Requests for Information Policy.\n\nAffiliated Businesses: Etsy is affiliated with a variety of businesses and works closely with them for a variety of purposes, including assisting us to perform and improve the Services. These businesses may sell items or services to you through the Services or, with your consent, offer promotions (including email promotions) to you. Etsy also provides services or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses, including providing you with the opportunity to sign up with such partners and allow them to more effectively market to you. When an affiliated business assists in facilitating your transaction, we may need to share information related to the transaction with that affiliated business in order to facilitate your transaction, and this forms part of the Services we provide in accordance with our Terms of Use. We rely on consent (which can be withdrawn at any time) to send marketing messages and for third-party sharing relating to advertising. As part of this, we may work with advertising partners such as Facebook or Google, and we may use analytics aggregated from usage information including, for example, search keywords, favorites, browsing history, and purchase history.\n\nAggregated Information: Etsy may share demographic information with business partners, but it will be aggregated and de-personalized so that personal information is not revealed.\n\nService Providers: Etsy also needs to engage third-party companies and individuals (such as research companies, and analytics and security providers) to help us operate, provide, and market the Services. These third parties have only limited access to your information, may use your information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and are obligated to Etsy not to disclose or use your information for other purposes. Our engagement of service providers is often necessary for us to provide the Services to you, particularly where such companies play important roles like helping us keep our Service operating and secure. In some other cases, these service providers aren\u2019t strictly necessary for us to provide the Services, but help us make it better, like by helping us conduct research into how we could better serve our users. In these latter cases, we have a legitimate interest in working with service providers to make our Services better.\n\nBusiness Reorganization: In some cases, Etsy may choose to buy or sell assets. Such transactions may be necessary and in our legitimate interests, particularly our interest in making decisions that enable our business to develop over the long term. In these types of transactions (such as a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership, or transfer of all or substantially all of Etsy\u2019s assets), member information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. If Etsy intends to transfer information about you, Etsy will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Site and the App, and you will be afforded an opportunity to opt out before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy.\n\nThird Parties: Third-party plug-ins also collect information about your use of the Site. For example, when you load a page on Etsy that has a social plug-in from a third-party site or service, such as a \u201cLike\u201d or \u201cSend\u201d button, you are also loading content from that third-party site. That site may request cookies directly from your browser. These interactions are subject to the privacy policy of the third-party site. In addition, certain cookies and other similar technologies on the Site are used by third parties for targeted online marketing and other purposes. These technologies allow a partner to recognize your computer or mobile device each time you use the Services. Please be aware that when you use third-party sites or services, their own terms and privacy policies will govern your use of those sites or services. Etsy chooses and manages these third-party technologies placed on its Sites and Apps. However, these are third-party technologies, and they are subject to that third party's privacy policy. For more information, see our Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy. We rely on your consent to drop and read these cookies when not technically necessary or when not required based on another purpose such as legitimate interest.\n\nThis policy does not apply to the practices of third parties (such as other members who sell using the Services, certain third-party providers on whom we rely to provide certain services, or API users) that Etsy does not own or control or individuals that Etsy does not employ or manage, except as otherwise provided for in the Terms or as required by law. If you provide your information to such third parties in connection with your use of the Services, different practices may apply to the use or disclosure of the information that you provide to them. While Etsy requires these third parties to follow Etsy\u2019s privacy and security requirements, Etsy does not control the privacy or security policies of such third parties. To the full extent applicable in your jurisdiction, Etsy is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of these sellers, API users, or other websites on the internet, even those linked to or from the Services. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and ask questions of third parties before you disclose your personal information to them.

This information can include information such as the hardware model, operating system information, app version, app usage and debugging information, browser information, IP address, and device identifiers. For more information about these online tools and how we use them, see our Cookies & Similar Technologies Policy and \u201cInformation Uses, Sharing, & Disclosure\u201d Section below.\n\nData from Etsy Vendors and Suppliers: We also receive information from our vendors and suppliers about you. This information can include customer service interactions, payments information, shipping information, and information shared in Etsy\u2019s forums.\n\nData from Advertising and Marketing Partners: As described below, Etsy receives information from our advertising and marketing partners about you.

This can include your IP address, browser information (including referrers), device information (such as iOS IDFA, IDFV for limited non-advertising purposes, Android AAID, and, when enabled by you, location information provided by your device). When you use the Apps, you can choose to share your geolocation details with Etsy in order to use functions like our local marketplace, maps, and for in-person sales (although you don't need to share these details). You can choose to publish your location when you sell on Etsy.\n\nWe obtain location information you provide in your profile or your IP address. With your consent, we may also determine location by using other information from your device, such as precise location information from GPS or information about wireless networks or cell towers near your mobile device. We use and store information about your location to provide features and to improve and customize the Services, for example, for Etsy\u2019s internal analytics and performance monitoring; localization, regional requirements, and policies for the Services; for local content, search results, and recommendations; for shipping and mapping services; and (using non-precise location information) marketing. If you have consented to share your precise device location details but would no longer like to continue sharing that information with us, you may revoke your consent to the sharing of that information through the settings on the Apps or on your mobile device. Certain non-precise location services, such as for security and localized policies based on your IP address or submitted address, are critical for the Site to function. We will only share your geolocation details with third parties (like our mapping, payments, or, to the extent applicable, advertising providers) in order to provide you with the Services. You may also choose to enable the Apps to access your mobile device\u2019s camera to upload photographs to Etsy.\n\nAnalytics Information: We use data analytics software to ensure Site and App functionality and to improve the Services. This software records information such as how often you use the Apps, what happens within the Apps, aggregated usage, performance data, app errors and debugging information, and where the Apps were downloaded from. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information that you submit within the mobile application. For more information, see Etsy's Cookies and Similar Technologies Policy and Disclosures.\n\nInformation from Third Parties: Some members or visitors may choose to connect to Etsy or register an Etsy account using an external third-party application, such as Facebook, or an app developed using Etsy's API. Connecting your Etsy account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, Etsy can receive information from that application. We may also collect public information in order to connect with you, such as when we communicate with you over social media. We may use that information as part of providing the Services to you. You can also choose to share some of your activity on Etsy on certain social media networks which are connected to your Etsy account, and you can revoke your permission anytime in your account settings. Certain third-party applications that you use to create or sign in to your account may provide you with the option to discontinue receiving messages from us or allows you to forward those messages to another email address. If we are unable to send you critical messages about your account, we may suspend or terminate your account.\n\nNon-Member Information: Etsy receives or obtains information (for example, an email address or IP address) about a person who is not yet a registered Etsy member (a \u201cnon-member\u201d) in connection with certain Etsy features, such as when a non-member chooses to subscribe to an Etsy newsletter, a member invites a non-member to visit the Site, a member uploads non-member information using the contact uploader feature, a non-member engages in a transaction, a member sends a gift card code to a non-member, or a non-member uses Guest Checkout to make a purchase. Non-member information is used only for the purposes disclosed when it was submitted to Etsy, for purposes necessary to the functioning of Etsy's Services or where Etsy has a legitimate interest, as disclosed in the \u201cInformation Uses, Sharing, & Disclosure\u201d Section below, or to facilitate action authorized by a member or the non-member.\n\nPattern by Etsy: We also collect certain information from both members and non-members who visit websites hosted by us.

As you navigate through the services, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to better understand how the Services are being used.\n\n3.1 A 'cookie' is a text file that this site sends to your browser in the form of a text file The information generated by the cookie about your use of this site (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but they usually can be modified to decline cookies if you prefer; however, certain features of this site might not work without cookies.\n\n3.2 'Session' cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the Services 'remembers' previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on the Services. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer.\n\n3.3 'Persistent' cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, helping to determine what areas of the Services you may find most valuable, and customizing the Services based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold personal information.\n\n3.4 You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for 'cookie' in the 'Help' portion of your browser.\n\n3.5 An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and administer and improve the Services.\n\n3.6 'Internet tags' (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the Services and on different pages of the Services. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.\n\n3.7 'Navigational data' (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the Services, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.\n[...]\nWe will ask you for personal information when you sign up for any specific benefit or purpose that requires registration.
