  We're happy to maintain an open API that you can use to incorporate PrivacySpy into your own application. So long as you follow our [Terms](/terms-and-privacy/) and attribute the information back to PrivacySpy, you can use the data however you wish.

  The index of the PrivacySpy database is published at `/api/v2/index.json`. The full PrivacySpy database is split across three larger endpoints: `/api/v2/contributors.json` (contributors), `/api/v2/rubric.json` (rubric), and `/api/v2/products.json` (products). Individual product information can be accessed at `/api/v2/products/{slug}.json`.

    Want another endpoint? PrivacySpy is open source, so you can <a href="/contribute/">build it yourself</a>!
